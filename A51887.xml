                  <note>The first edition of this work began publication in 1684, when a volume in Italian entitled "L'esploratore Turco" and a French version entitled "L'esplou du grand seigneur" were published in Paris by C. Barbin. Authorship is disputed, but it is generally agreed that the first fifty letters (the original four volumes) were written by Marana. In the English editions, v. 1 contains the substance of the letters commonly ascribed to Marana. The continuation (i.e. v. 2-8), said to have appeared first in English, has been variously ascribed to Robert Midgley and William Bradshaw ; Bradshaw has also been attributed as the translator (from Marana's Italian manuscripts) of the entire work under Dr. Midgley's editorship. cf. DNB; also Gentleman's magazine, 1841, p. 270.</note>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THree Years are now elaps'd, ſince the <hi>Firſt Volume</hi> of <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> written by a <hi>Spy</hi> at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> was publiſh'd in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> And, it was expected, that a <hi>Second</hi> ſhould have come out long before this. The favourable Reception which that found amongſt all Sorts of Readers, would have encouraged a ſpeedy <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of the Reſt, had there been extant any <hi>French Edition,</hi> of more than the <hi>Firſt Part.</hi> But, after the ſtricteſt Enquiry, none could be heard of: And, as for the <hi>Italian,</hi> our <hi>Bookſellers</hi> have not that Correſpondence in thoſe Parts, as they have in the more Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Countries, of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi> So, that it was a Work deſpaired of, to recover any more of this <hi>Arabian's Memoirs.</hi> We little dreamt, that the <hi>Florentines</hi> had been ſo buſie in Printing, and ſo ſucceſsful in Selling the continued <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of theſe <hi>Arabian Epiſtles;</hi> till it was the
<pb facs="tcp:102956:4"/>Fortune of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman to travel in thoſe Parts laſt <hi>Summer,</hi> and diſcover the happy News. I will not foreſtal his <hi>Letter,</hi> which is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to this <hi>Preface,</hi> for the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the World: but only acquaint you, that upon the Receipt of it, the Perſon to whom it was directed, was ſo well pleaſed with the Propoſal, That he made it his immediate Buſineſs, to find out the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlator of the Firſt Volume, as judging him to be the fitteſt Perſon; which being done, he immediately gave an Account of his Proceedings to Mr. <hi>Saltmarſh</hi> at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi> who ſent him over Two <hi>Tomes</hi> of the <hi>Turkiſh Spy</hi> in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> with promiſe of the Reſt when theſe were made <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>One</hi> of theſe I here preſent you with, and the <hi>Other</hi> will ere long be ready for the Preſs.</p>
            <p>I need not ſay any Thing of the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Arabic,</hi> or of the <hi>Author,</hi> the <hi>Place</hi> of his <hi>Abode,</hi> and how his <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi> came to Light. Sufficient has been ſpoken on that Subject, in the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:102956:4"/>to the <hi>Firſt Part.</hi> I ſhall only add, That if his Style may ſeem in <hi>this</hi> Part, to vary ſometimes from the <hi>Firſt Volume,</hi> it muſt be attributed to the Difference of the <hi>Languages</hi> from whence they are <hi>Tranſlated;</hi> it being impoſſible to obſerve an equal <hi>Idiom,</hi> in following Two ſuch different <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,</hi> as <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian:</hi> The <hi>One</hi> dancing in ſoft Meaſures, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Cadencies and ſmooth Periods; the <hi>Other,</hi> advancing in lofty Strains, keeping a <hi>Roman</hi> Pace, full of Maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line and Sententious Gravity.</p>
            <p>Neither can the <hi>Arabian</hi> himſelf, be ſuppoſed always in the ſame Temper; or, that his Style ſhould be all of a Piece. In ſome Places, where he treats of Sieges and Battles, he ſeems to foot the <hi>Pyrrick</hi> Meaſures in <hi>Proſe;</hi> there breathes a certain <hi>Martial</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor in his Words. In other Places, on the ſame Subject, he goes on like an Impartial <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> barely rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Matter of Fact, without any Flowers or Gloſſes. He ſeems not to trifle with <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> or <hi>Religion;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:102956:5"/>but, handles the <hi>One</hi> in the peculiar <hi>Dialect</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and treats of the <hi>Other,</hi> in the caſtigate <hi>Language</hi> of the <hi>Weſtern Schools,</hi> to ſhew, he had been converſant in the <hi>Academies;</hi> as he himſelf profeſſes, <hi>Letter XX. Book I. Vol. I.</hi> In a Word, throughout all his <hi>Letters,</hi> there is a Queintneſs of Expreſſion, peculiar to the <hi>Arabians:</hi> And, however he may vary in his Style, yet his Sence retains the ſame Edge; he is lively to the very laſt. Nay, as far as I can perceive, both his Language, Sence, and Judgment grow more correct, as he advances in Years. And, you'll find ſome Difference between his <hi>Letters</hi> of <hi>1637.</hi> and <hi>1660.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Expect the whole <hi>Series</hi> of them, as faſt as they can conveniently be publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the <hi>Third Volume</hi> being almoſt ready for the Preſs: In which, the Reader will find the ſtrangeſt Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and moſt amazing Accidents, that ever happ'ned in the World ſince the <hi>Creation;</hi> with many <hi>French</hi> Intrigues a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>TRavelling through <hi>Italy</hi> this <hi>Summer,</hi> and coming to <hi>Ferrara</hi> about the Middle of <hi>June,</hi> I made ſome ſtay in that City, in Compliance with the Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of my Siſter, the Wife of <hi>Signior Nicolao Valentini,</hi> formerly <hi>Merchant</hi> in <hi>London.</hi> During my Abode at her Houſe, I was brought acquainted with that Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and Learned <hi>Phyſician, Julio de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis,</hi> of the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> and late <hi>Student</hi> at <hi>Padua.</hi> This accompliſh'd Perſon, receiv'd me with ſingular Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Friendſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In all his Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, giving Proofs of a Diſpoſition wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his Character, and the Blood which runs in his Veins. He is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally Learned; and, by his prodigious Reading, (which cannot be hid from thoſe who converſe with him,) he ſeem'd to me a <hi>Walking Library.</hi> You cannot name an <hi>Author</hi> of Note, with whom he is not acquainted; being a careful Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector,
<pb facs="tcp:102956:6"/>or rather an Engroſſer of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Books. He gave me familiar Acceſs to his <hi>Library,</hi> which, according to the beſt Computation I could make, conſiſted of no leſs than Six Thouſand choice <hi>Treatiſes.</hi> You know my Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and will eaſily believe, that I took no ſmall Delight, in the Liberty I had not only to ſurvey, but alſo to make uſe of this Treaſure, ſo long as I ſtay'd in <hi>Ferrara.</hi> I was there daily, and thought that Time miſpent, which my other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations took from my Study. Among other Books, I chanc'd to open the <hi>Italian Tranſlation</hi> of the <hi>Turkiſh Spy,</hi> which was ſo celebrated all over <hi>Europe,</hi> and which I had read both in <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh.</hi> I had the Curioſity to peruſe it over, and found it exactly to agree with thoſe <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations</hi> I had ſeen: which made me ask this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> Whether there were no more <hi>Volumes</hi> of it printed? He preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewed me <hi>Six</hi> more, and told me, the <hi>Eighth</hi> was in the Preſs. Over-joy'd at this News, I asked him, Where I might furniſh my ſelf with thoſe <hi>Seven Volumes</hi> already Printed? He aſſured me, the Firſt Impreſſions were all Sold off, but that they would be reprinted again. I expreſſed ſome Sorrow and Concern, that I could
<pb facs="tcp:102956:6"/>not procure thoſe Books; when, with an unparallell'd Generoſity, he frankly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed thoſe <hi>Seven Volumes</hi> upon me. 'Tis true, at our firſt Acquaintance, I had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged him with a <hi>Preſent,</hi> on which, I believe, he ſet a greater Price, than on theſe Books; it being a <hi>Watch</hi> of moſt cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Workmanſhip, made by One of the greateſt Artiſts in <hi>Italy.</hi> However, I phancy'd my Gift returned Seven-fold in theſe Books. I brought them along with me through <hi>Germany</hi> into <hi>Holland,</hi> where I keep them as a Secret Treaſure; being deſirous, if poſſible, that the <hi>Six Volumes</hi> which are not yet <hi>Tranſlated</hi> out of <hi>Italian,</hi> might firſt ſpeak my Native Tongue, that ſo we may not always be obliged to the <hi>French,</hi> for the moſt acceptable Products of the Preſs.

                  <p>I Know not whether it be a Vice or a Vertue, to be fearful in my Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. I am no <hi>Stoick,</hi> nor can I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend an Exemption from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Paſſions of Men. However, 'tis not for my ſelf I am ſolicitous, but I conſult the Good of my <hi>Commiſſion.</hi> There is a Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Caution and Fear; and, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102956:14"/>of Danger, is not to be termed Puſillanimity.</p>
                  <p>I have written Six Letters to <hi>Carcoa</hi> at <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna,</hi> but have received no Anſwer theſe Four <hi>Moons.</hi> This Neglect puts me upon Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and I am puzzled to find out an Excuſe for him. I would fain continue my good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of his Honeſty, without forfeiting my Senſe. For, although I am not naturally ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious, yet Experience has taught me, to number <hi>Jealouſie</hi> among the <hi>Cardinal</hi> Virtues.</p>
                  <p>Not to amuſe thee, I am afraid of Treachery. <hi>Carcoa</hi> knows the Secret of my <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> and it lies in his Power to do much Miſchief. Yet I may wrong the Man; perhaps he is dead: And there are no <hi>Poſts</hi> that bring News from the <hi>Grave.</hi> If he be in the Region of Silence, and expired in his Integrity, the <hi>Two Black Angels</hi> ſhall have no Power to hurt him. But, I wonder I ſhould have no Intelligence of his Death, neither from the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Port,</hi> nor from <hi>Eliachim</hi> the <hi>Jew.</hi> I tell thee, I am uneaſie till I know the Truth.</p>
                  <p>When I ſit in my Chamber, and hear any diſcourſing in the Houſe, I imagine 'tis about me; when I go along the Streets, if any Man faſtens his Eyes on me, he arreſts me with Fear and Apprehenſion. 'Tis true, I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to undergo the worſt they can inflict; but, it would extreamly enhaunce the Sorrows of Death, to ſee the <hi>Secrets</hi> of the <hi>Sublime Port,</hi> become the Scorn and Deriſion of <hi>Infidels.</hi>

                  <p>For theſe Reaſons, I have removed my ſelf about a League from <hi>Paris,</hi> pretending

                  <p>Thou wilt think I Romance in telling thee this, and only temporize with thy <hi>Genius,</hi> having often heard thee paſſionately admire the valiant Acts of <hi>Semiramis</hi> and other <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern

                  <p>THou that art daily converſant with the Eldeſt Products of the Earth, and canſt call the whole <hi>Vegetable</hi> Family by their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> Names, tell me whether there be ſuch a Plant, as by its baneful Influence blaſts all that grows within ten Cubits of its Root. I would not put ſuch a Queſtion to thee, had I not lately ſeen ſomething in the Garden of a certain <hi>Nobleman</hi> near <hi>Paris,</hi> which makes me think 'tis true. They call it here <hi>[the ill Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour]</hi> becauſe it preys (they ſay) on all the Herbage that is near it, riſing and flouriſhing by their Fall. Indeed, at that time I ſaw it, there was a wither'd Circle round it; whilſt this devouring Sprout look'd gay and full, augmented by the Spoils of Neighbouring Graſs. A proper <hi>Emblem</hi> of Oppreſſion; I wiſh 'twere growing in the Gardens of all <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Tyrants,</hi> that in this Natural Glaſs they might behold their Voracious Spirits.</p>
                  <p>I will not thus call in Queſtion thy Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102956:16"/>of an Herb, which ſhuns all humane touch. Here is one in the ſame Garden, which the <hi>Nobleman</hi> boaſts was by thy Hands cropt from the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Garden, and being ſet in a Pot of Earth, preſented to him. Thou didſt not well conſult thy Safety, in ſuch a grand Preſumption, nor yet the Honour of thy <hi>Sovereign Maſter,</hi> who (ſhould it ever reach his Ears) would ſoon tranſplant thee from the Garden of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> to the <hi>Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Fields.</p>
                  <p>Thou oughteſt to receive this Reprimand with higheſt Gratitude, ſince it will not ſhut thee out of thoſe pleaſant Walks and Groves within the <hi>High Imperial Walls.</hi> Uſe more Prudence another Time; and ſcorn ſuch eaſie Condeſcenſions to <hi>Infidels.</hi> Say, that I am thy Friend in this Advice; and, in Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence I only deſire this good Office of thee, To watch the Motions of my Enemies. There are no leſs than Three Great Officers of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> hammering out my Ruine. Thou knoweſt who I mean. Keep thy Integrity. The ſly inſinuating Words of <hi>Shaſhim Iſtham,</hi> the <hi>Black Eunuch,</hi> ſpoken not long ago in my Diſgrace to the <hi>Principal Secretary</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> quickly echoed to my Chamber in <hi>Paris.</hi> Be Silent and Wiſe.</p>

                     <hi>To the</hi> Kaimacham.</head>
                  <p>I Shall now acquaint thee with the Death of the <hi>Queen-Mother</hi> and <hi>Dowager</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who fell a Sacrifice to the Ambition of the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> as thoſe of her Party do commonly ſuggeſt. For, being highly diſgu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted at his Counſels, and Intreagues, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his playing the Incendiary, and inflaming thoſe of the <hi>Blood Royal</hi> one againſt another, ſhe departed from <hi>France,</hi> and by a kind of Voluntary Baniſhment, expoſed her ſelf to ſo many Inconveniences, Hardſhips, and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gors of Fortune, as ſeemed to haſten her End; Her Great Spirit chuſing rather to break, than bow to the turbulent <hi>Cardinal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She Sojourned in <hi>Flanders, Holland, England,</hi> and the <hi>Empire.</hi> Her Travels being chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd all along with a Mixture of Good and Evil. Here meeting with Reſpect, there with Indifference and Coldneſs, if not Contempt. In ſome Places, her Misfortunes were pitied, and the <hi>Cardinal</hi> blamed for Perſecuting ſo Great and Good a <hi>Queen:</hi> In others, the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi> was Juſtified, and her Conduct cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and condemned. And ſhe accuſed her ſelf, for raiſing him to the power of doing her theſe Injuries. At length, tired out with the Fatigues of <hi>State,</hi> and grown ſick of the World, ſhe betook her ſelf to a <hi>Monaſtery</hi> in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102956:18"/>
                     <hi>Colen,</hi> where, after ſhe had ſpent ſome time in Religious Preparations for another World, ſhe expired the 3d. of this Inſtant <hi>Moon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was placed among the Remarkables by ſome, that the ſame day ſhe died, the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi> of <hi>Richlieu</hi> fell ſick, which Sickneſs yet continues upon him. But, whether to appeaſe the <hi>Ghoſt</hi> of his deceaſed Miſtriſs, whom he had ſo unjuſtly perſecuted; or, to mollify the Reſentments of the People, is uncertain. Yet, notwithſtanding his dangerous Illneſs, he every Day ventures to the <hi>Temple,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of their <hi>Law</hi> for her Soul. The whole <hi>Court</hi> and City, is in Mourning for this Great Queen; and general Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Complaints, are raiſed againſt the <hi>Cardinal</hi> on this Occaſion; eſpecially among the Common People, who are ſo far from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining a better Opinion of him, for his daily Appearance at the Altar on Behalf of the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Soul, that they eſteem it but an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Hypocriſie, a Medly of Prieſt-Craft and State Artifice.</p>
                  <p>Here is a Report about the City, that the Queen<hi>'s Ghoſt</hi> appear'd to the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> as ſoon as ſhe was dead, ſeverely reproaching him with his Ambition and Ingratitude, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, That tho' he was laying the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Immortal Project, yet he ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver live to ſee it thrive but warned him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for <hi>Judgment,</hi> for that he ſhould not ſee another Year in Mortal State; upon which, they ſay, he immediately ſickned. And here are Prophecies privately ſcattered about, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102956:18"/>his Death in a ſhort time. This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, he labours under an unaccountable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, his Body ſtrangely waſting, as if it would evaporate it ſelf into Air; for, he ſeems to be in a manner dried up.</p>
                  <p>My Duty and Devoir to thee, Sage Miniſter, would not let me be at Reſt till I had preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Poſts,</hi> by giving thee a more timely Account of theſe Occurrences, by a Merchant for whom his Veſſel waits at <hi>Marſeilles.</hi> To morrow he takes his Leave of <hi>Paris,</hi> and once aboard he makes directly for <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whither he will bring the firſt News of the Death of one of the greateſt <hi>Queens</hi> upon Earth, in whoſe <hi>Royal</hi> Veins ran the Blood of the <hi>Emperors, Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> V.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102956:19"/>Majeſty</hi>'s diſpleaſure. That they have by all the Arts of Malice, faſtned the Publick <hi>Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> on me, is a great <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappineſs; but, this is the Maſter-piece of their Enmity, to render me ſuſpected by you. I could pardon their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Attempts upon my Life, by private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies and Aſſaſſinations, though Humane Nature recoils at thoſe who are our Murderers: But, to deprive me of that, without which Life it ſelf is a burden to me, I mean, your <hi>Royal</hi> Favour, tranſports me beyond my ſelf; And, I beg, that it may paſs for an Excuſe of this Preſumption. I could eaſily have paſs'd over in Silence all their barbarous Plots againſt me! I could eaſily have parted with my Life, and all thoſe Honours and Dignities with which it has been bleſs'd. But, to rob me of your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, which firſt rais'd me to this Envied Greatneſs, and which I value more than all the Grandeurs of the Earth, breaks the Barrs which aw'd my Tongue and Pen, and makes me bold to throw my ſelf at your <hi>Royal</hi> Feet, with All that I have; for, I received All from your Princely Hands.

But, Madam, let your Native Piety prompt you to favour the <hi>Purple</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> with which your Bounty has Inveſted me. Let it not loſe its proper Luſtre and Eſteem, becauſe the Enemies of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> have caſt ſuch Dirt upon it. Is it poſſible, that a Man the moſt obliged of all his Race, ſhould become the onely Pattern of the baſeſt Ingratitude? Beſides the Ties of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102956:20"/>Conſcience and the Natural Force of Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, my Intereſt chains me to your Service; How can I then withdraw my ſelf from it, and not proclaim my ſelf at once a Traitor to the Reſt of Queens, and the moſt unaccountable of Fools to my ſelf?</p>

                     <hi>To</hi> Dgnet Oglou.</head>
                  <p>IT is now paſt Midnight, and being call'd out of my Bed by the People of the Houſe where I lodge, I knew not how to beſtow my Time better, than in giving thee an Account of this Occurrence.</p>
                  <p>Here is now ſo violent a Tempeſt of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Lightning and Rain, that the whole He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſphere ſeems to be on Fire, and the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious are overwhelmed with <hi>Panick</hi> Fears, concluding this Storm will uſher in the <hi>Day
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102956:22"/>of Judgment.</hi> It has continued theſe two Hours; and, they tell me, that no leſs than Twenty Houſes are burnt to Aſhes already. I had ſcarce taken my Pen from the laſt Word, when a Flaſh of Lightning dyed all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and Books, on the Table whereon I now write, as black as Soot; whereof this ſcorch'd Paper may be a Teſtimonial, which I ſend en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed. Obſerve but the Colour and Smell, and thou wilt ſay, 'tis ſtamp'd with the Mark of the <hi>Thunderer.</hi> 'Tis that whereon I had begun to write to thee; but, this thirſty Fire, at a Moment, lick'd up all the Ink, ſo that the Impreſſion is wholly effac'd.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſon of their calling me out of my Bed was, to go to Prayers with them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Cuſtom of theſe <hi>Infidels,</hi> who in Time of Thunder, light certain <hi>Conſecrated</hi> Candles, and fall on their Knees round about them, imagining, that whilſt they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Room where theſe Candles are, the Thunder cannot hurt them. I excuſed my ſelf from keeping them Company, by telling them, I had a <hi>Hallowed</hi> Candle in my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which I would light and ſay my Prayers there. They were ſatisfied with this Anſwer, and ſprinkling me with <hi>Holy Water,</hi> to bleſs me from the Danger impending, I retired.</p>
                  <p>There is a private Stair-Caſe in my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which leads to a Terraſs on the Top of the Houſe. My Curioſity carried me thither, where methought I beheld <hi>Nature</hi> in her Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks and Rants. The greateſt part of the Sky was clear and ſerene, and innumerable
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102956:22"/>Stars appeared; but, round the Brims of the <hi>Horizon,</hi> a growing Bulk of Clouds encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the Earth, ſpouting forth Cataracts of Fire from oppoſite Parts. One would have thought they were impregnated with Bombs and Carcaſſes, and that ſome Armies were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battell'd in the Air.</p>
                  <p>After this, as if theſe had been the Heralds of the laſt and fierceſt Combat, the Clouds drew up into a Point, and mingling with each other, ſhot forth ſuch Showers of Fire, as made the World look like a Furnace. For my Part, I had not Courage enough to ſtand longer in the open Air, but came down to my Chamber, and falling proſtrate on the Ground, recommended my ſelf to the <hi>Great Creator of all Things, Lord of Nature,</hi> and <hi>Sovereign Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of the Lives of Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither do I think my ſelf Superſtitious in this, any more than I ſhould be, in hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling my ſelf in the Duſt, before the <hi>Terrible Ibrahim</hi> when he is out of Temper.</p>
                  <p>Methinks, <hi>Nature</hi> ſeems to be in a Chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Fit, when it Thunders; and, 'tis neither good Manners nor Policy, to draw her Fury on our Heads by daring Carriage.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Holy Law,</hi> which preſcribes <hi>Prayer</hi> to us at the firſt Appearance of the Sun and Moon, ſeems to intimate, that on any Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency which gives us a peculiar Occaſion to contemplate an <hi>Omnipotent Power,</hi> we ought to fall down and adore the <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal One.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:102956:23"/>
                  <p>I am almoſt deaf with the Bells, which are rung in every <hi>Church</hi> of the City on this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. It being the Opinion of the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> that this Noiſe will chaſe away the Tempeſt, with all Evil Spirits that infeſt the Air. And this Opinion is grounded, on the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> which are uſed at the <hi>Conſecratioa</hi> of their Bells. For, the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> or, in his Abſence, the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> hallows them with a kind of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and a Form of Prayer; wherein, among other Petitions, they deſire of <hi>God,</hi> to endue them with a Virtue to reſiſt the <hi>Devils.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am no Friend to <hi>Superſtition,</hi> neither do I give much Credit to <hi>Charms;</hi> yet I cannot deny, but the ringing ſuch a vaſt Number of Bells, muſt needs cauſe a violent Concuſſion of the Air; even to the diſperſing of the Clouds, and producing a Calm. And Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience aſſures us, that this is the common Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of a Battle, which if it happen in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous Weather, yet the Diſcharge of many Thouſand Great and Small Shot, has quieted the Storm, and huſh'd the Elements into a very ſerene Condition.</p>
                  <p>Though this Noiſe of Bells be very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, in a Time when People ſhould take their Repoſe, yet here we are uſed to it in a leſs Degree, every Night throughout the Year.</p>
                  <p>For, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Law, requires the <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes</hi> to riſe at Midnight, to ſay their Prayers in their Chappels; and, ſome are ſo devout and regular, as to make this their conſtant Cuſtom: ſo that aſſoon as the Clocks have ſtruck <hi>Twelve,</hi> the ſmall Bells in ſome <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents</hi>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:102956:23"/>begin to jangle. About <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Three</hi> Hours afterwards, other <hi>Religious</hi> Houſes ring their Bells, and ſo continue at certain Hours Day and Night all the Year long.</p>
                  <p>The Storm is now quite blown over, the Clouds diſpers'd, and all Things huſh and quiet.</p>
                  <p>He that brings forth Light out of Darkneſs, and converts the Terrors and Sadneſs of the Night, into the chearful Joys of a fair and propitious Morning, have thee in his keeping, and perpetuate our Friendſhip.</p>

                  <head>LETTER VIII.</head>
                  <head>To the ſame.</head>
                  <p>THere lives a <hi>Derviſe</hi> in this City, with whom I often converſe with the ſame Freedom as I do with thee; and, it is no ſmall Alleviation of my Melancholy, to vent my Thoughts to one of an agreeable Spirit.</p>
                  <p>He is a <hi>Religious</hi> of <hi>Mount Carmel;</hi> a Man of Singular Piety and Vertue; and, were he not ſo Zealous a Patron of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions and Idolatry, I ſhould eſteem him a <hi>Saint.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have often attempted to wean him by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102956:24"/>Degrees, from the Errors which he imbib'd with his Mothers Milk, and which ſeem to be rooted in him through the Influences of his Education.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes I plant a Battery of Arguments againſt Images and Pictures; but, I can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beat them down from the Poſts they are allotted in his <hi>Oratory,</hi> nor am I able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh the Chappels which he has built for their <hi>Ideas</hi> in his own Breaſt.</p>
                  <p>Yet, after a long and cloſe Siege, I have reduced him to Terms of Compoſition. In the firſt place, he has ſurrendred up a Picture which hung in his Cloſet, in Form of a very Ancient Man with hoary Hairs, deſigned by the Painter, to repreſent the Perſon of <hi>God.</hi> He yields, that it is not lawful to make any Reſemblance of the <hi>Inviſible Divinity.</hi> Next he allows, that it is not lawful to bow or ſhew any other External Reſpect: to the Pictures and Images of <hi>Jeſus, Mary,</hi> and the Reſt of the <hi>Saints,</hi> but only to uſe them as Hiſtorical Remembrancers of thoſe Holy Perſons, and as Natural Helps and Spurs to Devotion and Vertue.</p>
                  <p>I tell thee, my Friend <hi>Oglou,</hi> on theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulations I could not but raiſe the Siege, and yield him the Uſe of Pictures thus far a blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Practice. For, it ſeems to me unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, to debarr thoſe who believe the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the Privilege to read it in what Language they pleaſe, whether this of Images and Pictures, or that of Letters.</p>
                  <p>Letters are but the Images of ſuch and ſuch
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102956:24"/>Articulate Sounds, by which we expreſs our Inward Conception of things: But, Images and Pictures are the lively Immediate Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of the Things themſelves; and, it ſeems as eaſie to me, to look on a Picture or Image without the Danger of Idolatry, as 'tis to read a Chapter in the <hi>Alcoran</hi> without ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Letters that compoſe it. Was not the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> adorned with Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of <hi>Cherubims?</hi> Was not the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Solomon</hi> deck'd in the ſame manner? If the preſence of Images in Temples be a propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, why for ſo many Ages have our <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Mufti's</hi> ſuffered the Two <hi>Seraphims</hi> to remain under the <hi>Cupola</hi> of the <hi>Moſque</hi> of <hi>Sancta Sophia</hi> in <hi>Conſtantinople?</hi> Why do they not deface the Picture of <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Two Images of <hi>Angels,</hi> with other Pieces of Sculpture and Painting in the ſame place? Are the Devotions of a <hi>Muſſulman</hi> in this Sacred Temple tainted with Idolatry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he prays before theſe Images?</p>
                  <p>Let me unboſom my Thoughts to thee with freedom; Images and Pictures are no Bug-bears to me; I can uſe them as Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Devotion, in the ſame manner as I do Books. Yet every one cannot do this without Danger of Idolatry; neither is a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Toleration of Images and Pictures in Temples to be approved. For, though ſome Men may look on them without Hurt, yet 'tis hard for the Generality to avoid falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Culpable Reverence. For, while the Eye is drinking in the fair <hi>Idea,</hi> the Soul is apt to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102956:25"/>loſe her Force, and fall into Admiration of the Carver's or the Painter's Art, adoring the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Symmetry of a Beautiful Picture or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, inſtead of the <hi>Original</hi> and <hi>Increated Beauty,</hi> the <hi>Majeſty</hi> which has no Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance.</p>
                  <p>Therefore wiſely has our <hi>Holy Law,</hi> provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt this Inconvenience, by diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <hi>Imagery</hi> throughout the <hi>Sacred Empire</hi> of the <hi>Muſſulmans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He whoſe Habitation is in the Myſterious and Inacceſſible Heighth of an Eternal Receſs, whoſe Glory is beyond all Figure and Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, augment thy Vertues, which are the trueſt Images of the Divine Nature.</p>

                     <hi>To the</hi> Kaimacham.</head>
                  <p>THE preſent <hi>War</hi> betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> however begun, ſeems to be carried on by a Principle of <hi>Honour,</hi> rather than of <hi>Enmity.</hi> Theſe two Nations are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Antipodes</hi> to each other in their Humours, yet this Averſion between them, is diſcover'd more in Peace than in War. The Queſt of Glory has invited many brave Men on both Sides into the Field; and, the <hi>Hero's</hi> ſtrive to conquer each other, by <hi>Civilities</hi> rather than by <hi>Arms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Catalonia</hi> and <hi>Rouſſilion,</hi> were the Stages of this War, in the Beginning of the Year; where the <hi>Mareſchal de Breze,</hi> and the <hi>Sieur de la Mothe-Houdancourt,</hi> combated with all the Hardſhips of the Winter, as well as with Valiant Enemies. The Rigour of the Seaſon did not cool the Courage of theſe <hi>Generals,</hi> nor divert their <hi>Reſolution</hi> from taking the Field. All the Country appear'd like a frozen Lake, and there was no Place for them to encamp, but in Deep Snows or Ice: yet, for all theſe Diſcouragements, the <hi>Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchal de Breze</hi> block'd up <hi>Perpignan,</hi> a Town of great Strength in <hi>Rouſſilion,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Sieur de la Mothe</hi> kept the <hi>Arragonians</hi> in Play, and baffl'd the Enterpriſes of the <hi>Caſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> having given them two Signal Defeats.</p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:102956:26"/>
                  <p>Theſe ſucceſsful Actions of the <hi>French Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,</hi> invited the King their Maſter to give them a Viſit, being very deſirous to take <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pignan,</hi> and ſettle the Affairs of <hi>Catalonia.</hi> He therefore ſends another Army under the Command of the <hi>Mareſchal de la Meſleraye,</hi> which he ſoon followed in Perſon.</p>
                  <p>There was now a generous Envy raiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſo many Great Commanders, every one ſtriving to advance himſelf in the King's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem by his Services. And the particular Merits of the <hi>Sieur de la Mothe,</hi> drew a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Eye on him. The King made him <hi>Mareſchal</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> the Staff which is the Badge of his Office, being preſented to him by the <hi>Mareſchal de Breze</hi> at <hi>Barcelona,</hi> to the general Satisfaction and Joy as well of the <hi>Catalonians</hi> as the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Honour was conferr'd on him, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after the great Victory obtained over the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Forces, at <hi>Ville-Franche</hi> in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talonia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean while, the <hi>Mareſchal de Meſleraye,</hi> inveſted the ſtrong Caſtle of <hi>Coli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oubre,</hi> which was ſurrender'd to him upon honourable Terms, by the <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare, General</hi> of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe in <hi>Rouſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> and <hi>Governour</hi> of that Caſtle.</p>
                  <p>The King fluſh'd with Conqueſts and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, would not ſuffer his Army to lie idle, but in good earneſt laid cloſe Siege to <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pignan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet ſuch was the Generoſity of this Prince, that before he tried the Force of his Cannon,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102956:26"/>he ordered the <hi>Mareſchal de Meſleraye,</hi> to ſend a Herald to the <hi>Marquis de Flores,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Town, to put him in Mind of the great Streights the Beſieged were in for want of Proviſions, of which his Majeſty was not ignorant; and, that there was no Hopes of Relief from the <hi>Marquis de Povar, General</hi> of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Forces in <hi>Arragon,</hi> there being left alive but a few Companies of all his Army, after the great Defeat which was given them near <hi>Ville-Franche.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He offered the <hi>Governour</hi> all fair and good Uſage, if he would ſurrender before Things came to Extremities; and, to convince him of the entire Loſs of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army (to which he truſted) he promiſed Safe Conduct to any Officer of the Garriſon as far as <hi>Terragone,</hi> where lay all the little Remnant of the <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonian</hi> Army, that ſo he might inform and aſſure himſelf of the bad Condition the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Affairs were in.</p>
                  <p>This Favour was received with much Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility by the <hi>Marquis de Povar,</hi> who retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Humble Thanks to the King for ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a Condeſcention, aſſuring him withal, that the Garriſon was not reduced to thoſe Streights as was pretended, but that he never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs accepted his Majeſty's ſafe Conduct to a Meſſenger; entreating him, that he would permit him to go to <hi>Madrid,</hi> that ſo the King of <hi>Spain</hi> might have Advice of his Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt confeſs, Illuſtrious <hi>Kaimacham,</hi> that it was a great Magnanimity of Spirit in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102956:27"/>the King, to grant this Requeſt to an Enemy, who might be ſuſpected to deſign no more in it than gain Time. Yet, he ſent the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger back again, with full Aſſurance of his Royal Leave.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt this was in Agitation, many other Civilities paſs'd between the <hi>French</hi> and the Beſieged; Many Priſoners of Note were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed, and all Things ſeem'd to ſpeak a fair Underſtanding between both Parties; when, on a ſudden, the Cannon of the Town play'd furiouſly on the King's Quarters, and at the ſame Time the Beſieged made a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Sally, attacking a <hi>Redoubt</hi> which the <hi>Mareſchal de Meſleraye</hi> had raiſed.</p>
                  <p>This Contempt of the King's Favour raiſed his Choler, and animated the Soldiers with a deſire of Revenge. All ran to their Arms, and quickly beat back the Beſieged. Thus was the Face of Affairs ſuddenly chang'd in the Camp. It was too late now, for the <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> to expect the Courteſie he before abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. However, he ſent two Deputies again, to know if the King's Reſolution continued to grant Leave to ſend to <hi>Madrid,</hi> (for they had not as yet ſent.)</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mareſchal de Meſleraye</hi> ſent back the Deputies with this Anſwer, That if they did not engage to ſurrender by a prefix'd Day, and give two Hoſtages for Security of their Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, the King would not grant their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</p>
                  <p>This put the Beſieged upon deſperate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions; they made frequent Sallies, and all things tended to Extremity.</p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:102956:27"/>
                  <p>Whilſt Matters were in this Poſture, the King, by the Advice of his Phyſicians, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew from the Camp to take the Waters of <hi>Maine</hi> for his Health. This was in the laſt <hi>Moon,</hi> and <hi>Perpignan</hi> holds out ſtill.</p>
                  <p>I have been the more particular in relating this Siege, in regard it is the Chief Subject of Diſcourſe among ſuch as are deſirous of News. Which is the Reaſon alſo, that I begin this Letter with a Relation of what has been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in <hi>Catalonia</hi> ever ſince the Beginning of this Year, that thou maiſt be able to form a Regular <hi>Idea,</hi> of this preſent War between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> I will continually ſend thee an Account of the Progreſs the <hi>French</hi> make in <hi>Catalonia.</hi>

                  <p>Thou knoweſt, that it is the Cuſtom of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to make Pilgrimages from all Parts of the World to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and other Places in the <hi>Holy Land;</hi> even as the <hi>Faithful Muſſulmen</hi> do to <hi>Mecca</hi> and <hi>Medina Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabi</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> where is the <hi>Sepulchre</hi> of our <hi>Holy Prophet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here are Two <hi>Noblemen</hi> of the firſt Rank and Quality at <hi>Court,</hi> who out of Devotion to their <hi>Meſſias,</hi> went to viſit his ſuppoſed <hi>Sepulchre;</hi> and, in their Travels, paſs'd through Part of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> But when they arrived at a Place called <hi>Salhia,</hi> bordering on the <hi>Stony Arabia,</hi> they were made a Prey to the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſee</hi> of that Place; who, underſtanding from the Captain of the <hi>Caravan,</hi> that theſe two were all the <hi>Franks</hi> he had with him, and that they were Men of Money, he exacted from them twenty Dollars apiece for their Heads, contrary to all Law, Juſtice or Precedent;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102956:28"/>which they refuſing to pay (as indeed it was unreaſonable) the covetous old <hi>Subbaſſee</hi> commits them to Priſon, commanding them to receive a Hundred <hi>Baſtinadoes</hi> apiece on the Feet, thinking by this Means to frighten them to a Compliance with his Extortion. But they would not pay the Money, chuſing rather to ſuffer, than encourage ſuch Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in corrupt Officers. In the mean time, the <hi>Caravan</hi> departs, leaving theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon'd <hi>Lords</hi> to the Mercy of the <hi>Subbaſſee;</hi> who finding them inflexible, cauſed his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments to be put in Execution, and not content with this, orders his Slaves to beat them out of the Town.</p>
                  <p>The poor <hi>Lords</hi> knew not what to do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Misfortune; for they were ſo ſore with the Blows they had received on their tender Feet, that they were incapable of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling afoot. But, with Money they prevail on the Slaves, to direct them how they might procure Camels, with a Guide. This done they overtake the <hi>Caravan</hi> at <hi>Gaza,</hi> and ſo finiſh'd their Pilgrimage. They are now at the <hi>Court</hi> here, and have made known the Buſineſs to the King, who, 'tis ſaid, has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd an Expreſs to his Ambaſſador at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> to demand Juſtice on the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Subbaſſee;</hi> threatning, that if it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd, he will cover the Ocean with Ships, and raze the Palace of the <hi>Sultan</hi> to the Ground. For, theſe two <hi>Noblemen,</hi> are nearly allied to the <hi>Royal Family.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know thou wilt deſpiſe the bold <hi>Bravado</hi>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:102956:29"/>of this King, and ſo do I, being aſſured, that the <hi>Invincible Sultan,</hi> can ſet his Foot on the Necks of Forty ſuch Petty Kings as this. Yet, let us be the Advocates of Juſtice, by which the Refulgent Empire of the <hi>Muſſulmen</hi> was firſt eſtabliſhed. Should ſuch a Villainy as this go unpuniſhed, it would encourage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in like Caſes, and then there would be nothing but Extortion, and cruel Inſolence practis'd by Governours of Towns and Cities on the Road. So barbarous and Inhoſpitable Uſage, would provoke all the Princes of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Law, to take up Arms againſt us. Thus would the moſt Glorious Empire in the World, become a Prey to <hi>Infidels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know this would be miſrepreſented, were it to come to other Hands than thine. They would ſay of me openly, what they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready whiſpered in the Cabals of the <hi>Seraglio, That</hi> Mahmut <hi>is in Penſion with the</hi> French <hi>King.</hi> They ſeek my Life without a Cauſe. But I truſt it to thy generous and right no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hands, of whoſe Friendſhip I have had ſo late Experience.</p>
                  <p>May the <hi>Firſt Mover</hi> of the Heavenly Orbs, lead thee as by a Clew of Thread, through the dark Labyrinth of State Affairs, and bring thee, after a long and happy Life, to the <hi>Fields of endleſs Light.</hi> Amen! thou <hi>Lord of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe.</hi>

                     <hi>To</hi> Nathan Ben Saddi, <hi>a</hi> Jew <hi>at</hi> Vienna.</head>
                  <p>I Know thee not, and, 'tis probable, that art as little acquainted with me; Yet, I have often obſerved more durable Friendſhips con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted between Strangers, than betwixt thoſe of the ſame Blood. Good Offices equally deſerve and attract Love. There are many Opportunities for Travellers to ſerve one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And, he that obliges me in a ſtrange Country, makes himſelf my Brother.</p>
                  <p>I received a <hi>Diſpatch</hi> from the <hi>Reis Effendi</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> informing me of the Death of <hi>Carcoa,</hi> one of the <hi>Happy Slaves</hi> of <hi>him</hi> whom <hi>God</hi> has ordained to diſpenſe <hi>Felicities</hi> to the <hi>World,</hi> I mean, the <hi>Grand Signior, Poſſeſſor</hi> of the <hi>moſt exalted Throne on Earth.</hi> He tells me likewiſe, that I muſt expect from thee the Continuance of <hi>Carcoa</hi>'s Office. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate thy Honour, in that thou art thought worthy to ſerve the <hi>Great Viceroy</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe,</hi> to whom is committed the Flaming Sword of Juſtice, that he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Vertue, puniſh Vice, and reform the Corrupt Manners of all Mankind.</p>
                  <p>I am a <hi>Muſſulman,</hi> that is, reſigned to <hi>God,</hi> or elſe it would have raiſed ſome Thoughtfulneſs in a Man of my Circumſtances, what ſhould
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102956:30"/>be the Reaſon of <hi>Carcoa</hi>'s ſo long Silence, not having received any Anſwer theſe Four <hi>Moons</hi> to the many Letters I ſent him. He was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the Secrets of my <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> and, had another been in my Place, he would have ſuſpected Treachery.</p>
                  <p>Well, he is gone! gone to the Inviſible Regions, to the Receptacles of Juſt and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Men, to the pleaſant Woods and Groves, the Eternal Blooming Shades and Verdant Fields of <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> Follow his Steps, and be happy.</p>
                  <p>He was a Man true to his Truſt, ſedulous and active in Buſineſs; Punctual in his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments; Temperate in a Town flowing with Debaucheries; juſt toward all Men, and Devout to <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is neceſſary for him that would attain theſe Virtues, to begin Gradually at the loweſt Step; to Guard his <hi>Sences,</hi> and ſet a Watch upon the Avenues of his <hi>Paſſions.</hi> For a Man becomes neither perfectly Virtuous nor Vicious all at once: And a Wiſe Man of thy own Nation, <hi>Jeſus Ben Sirach,</hi> has ſaid, <hi>He that contemns Little Things, ſhall fall by little and little.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I deſire thee, to ſend me <hi>Carcoa</hi>'s <hi>Journal,</hi> with what other Papers he left behind him, except ſuch as concern his particular Eſtate and Affairs.</p>
                  <p>Let me know alſo, how the late Deſign of the <hi>Turks</hi> upon <hi>Rab,</hi> is reſented at the <hi>German Court;</hi> whether the <hi>Emperor</hi> talks of ſending an <hi>Embaſſador</hi> to the <hi>Sultan</hi> about
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102956:30"/>it; and, whatſoever alſo of Moment occurs.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Reis Effendi</hi> tells me, that <hi>Bechir Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> the Treaſurer, has ordered me Five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Zechins,</hi> by the way of <hi>Vienna.</hi> I deſire thou would'ſt be ſpeedy and careful in remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou needeſt no Inſtructions concerning my Lodging, or the Name I go by here; thoſe who appointed thee this Station at <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna,</hi> have informed thee, no doubt, of all Things neceſſary to the Diſcharge of thy Duty.</p>

                  <p>I Know thy <hi>Genius,</hi> and have obſerved with what Complacency thou wert wont to peruſe thy Uncle <hi>Shela Raphim</hi>'s Travels, a <hi>Journal</hi> writ in <hi>Arabick,</hi> and full of profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and wiſe Remarks; eſpecially, that Part of it, which treats of <hi>France.</hi> I will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to add to his Obſervations; but only acquaint thee with a Novelty, which <hi>France</hi> it ſelf ne'er knew in his Days.</p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:102956:31"/>
                  <p>The Women of <hi>Quality</hi> here of late, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict themſelves to the Studies of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> as the Men; the Ladies eſteeming their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation defective, if they cannot confute <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> and his <hi>Diſciples.</hi> The <hi>Pen</hi> has almoſt ſupplanted the Exerciſe of the <hi>Needle;</hi> and, Ladies Cloſets, formerly the Shops of Female Baubles, Toys and Vanities, are now turn'd to Libraries and Sanctuaries of Learned Books. There is a new Star riſen in the <hi>French</hi> Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, whoſe Influence excites the Nobler Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males to this purſuit of <hi>Humane Science.</hi> It is the Renowned Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> whoſe Luſtre far out-ſhines the Aged, winking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of <hi>Peripatetick Philoſophy,</hi> and has e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clips'd the <hi>Stagyrite,</hi> with all the Ancient Lights of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi> 'Tis this match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Soul, has drawn ſo many of the Fairer Sex to the Schools. And, they are more proud of the Title <hi>[Carteſian,]</hi> and of the Capacity to defend his <hi>Principles,</hi> than of their <hi>Noble</hi> Birth and Blood.</p>
                  <p>I know our Grave and Politick <hi>Muſſulmen,</hi> will cenſure the Indulgence of the <hi>French</hi> to their Women, and accuſe them of Weakneſs, in giving ſuch Advantages to that witty Sex. But, notwithſtanding this Severity of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Parts, I cannot altogether diſapprove the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Galantry. If Women are to be eſteemed <hi>our Enemies,</hi> methinks it is an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cowardiſe thus to diſarm them, and not allow them the ſame Weapons we uſe our ſelves: But, if they deſerve the Title of <hi>our Friends,</hi> 'tis an Inhumane Tyranny to debar
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102956:31"/>them the Privilege of Ingenuous Education, which would alſo render their Friendſhip ſo much more delightful both to themſelves and us. <hi>Nature</hi> is ſeldom obſerved to be niggardly of her choiceſt Gifts to that Sex, their Sences generally as quick as ours, their Reaſon as Nervous, their Judgments as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſolid. Add but to theſe Natural Perfections, the Advantage of Acquir'd Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, what polite and charming Creatures will they prove, whilſt their External Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty does the Office of a Cryſtal to the Lamp, not ſhrouding but diſcloſing their brighter Intellects? Nor need we fear to loſe our Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire over them, by thus improving their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Abilities; ſince, where there is moſt Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Sence and Knowledge, there is obſerv'd to be the greateſt Modeſty, and Rectitude of Manners. I ſee no Reaſon therefore, why we ſhould make ſuch Bug-Bears of Women, as not truſt them with as <hi>Liberal</hi> Education as our ſelves.</p>

                  <p>THere is a Garden in this City, ſo near reſembling that of the <hi>Invincible Vizir Azem,</hi> on the Eaſt of <hi>Pera,</hi> that I cannot but phanſie my ſelf near <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> when I am walking in it. It is called the <hi>King's Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> being allotted by the <hi>Royal Bounty</hi> of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> to the Service and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Students in <hi>Phyſick.</hi> There is a Yearly Stipend ſettled on an approved <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> to take Care, that no kind of Phyſical Plant or Herb be wanting in this <hi>Royal</hi> Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. Who alſo during the whole Summer, is obliged to read a <hi>Latin</hi> Lecture every Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, on the <hi>Simples</hi> there growing; whilſt a great Auditory of Young Students, with Books, Pen and Ink in their Hands, wait on him up and down the Alleys, and write down his Diſcourſe. He that is now employed in this Office, is a very Learned and Ingenious Man; he takes great Pains to make all his Young Diſciples perfect <hi>Herbaliſts;</hi> for, all the way as he paſſes along from one Herb to another,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102956:32"/>he ſtoops down, handles the <hi>Simple,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains his Verbal Deſcription with his Fingers Ends; giving a moſt accurate account of the minuteſt Difference between ſuch as ſeem to be alike, and demonſtrating to the Eye, that thoſe are two diſtinct Plants, which many take to be but one; tracing out their different Families, in the Number, Texture, Shape or Colour of their Leaves and Flowers: And, this he does with ſo graceful an Action, ſuch elegant Language, and ſo compoſed a Spirit, that he charms all that happen to be preſent at his Lectures, and makes every Body in Love with the <hi>Botanicks.</hi> The Garden ſtands open to all Gentlemen, provided they leave their Swords with the Keeper of the Gate, to prevent Quarrels and Miſchief.</p>
                  <p>I enter daily among the reſt, and when the <hi>Phyſick-Lecture</hi> is over, I retire my ſelf into one of the moſt pleaſant Shades in the World; it is a Gravel Walk, the whole length of the Garden, on each ſide of which grow lofty Trees, planted ſo thick, and intermixing their Leaves and Branches ſo cloſely at the Top, that they compoſe a perfect natural <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrella</hi> over the Walk, from one End to the other, ſo that not a Beam of the Sun can enter. And, that which creates in me the greateſt Complacency, is, that the farther End of the Walk, is not ſhut up by a high Wall, as is the Cuſtom in ſome Gardens; but, whether you are ſitting, or ſtanding upright, it opens to you a very agreeable and large Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Country adjacent to <hi>Paris,</hi> which
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102956:33"/>affects the Eye with incredible Delight; and mine ſo much the more, becauſe it perfectly reſembles the Country lying Eaſt of <hi>Pera</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which you ſurvey out of the <hi>Grotto</hi>'s of the aforeſaid moſt Illuſtrious <hi>Vizir Azem.</hi> 'Tis when I am in this Walk, I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine I breath the Air of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and am within the Verge of the <hi>Imperial Seraglio,</hi> the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary</hi> to which all the diſtreſs'd Princes in the World have Recourſe.</p>
                  <p>There are in <hi>Paris</hi> above an Hundred Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Palaces, and beautiful Gardens belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them; but, none wherein I take ſo particular a Delight, as in this Royal <hi>Phyſick-Garden.</hi> Here I ſpend many a ſolitary Hour, and ſometime I meet with Company.</p>
                  <p>I tell thee, Dear <hi>Haly,</hi> that though the <hi>French</hi> are naturally the moſt poliſhed and refined People in the World, yet I am ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times willing to make Excuſes, and leave their Society; being by the Force of a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inclination either drawn to this Garden, or to a famous Library in this City, in the Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of certain <hi>Religious Derviſes,</hi> who at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Hours of the Day, are obliged to give Attendance to all Gentlemen, who are pleaſed to ſit there and ſtudy.</p>
                  <p>Toward the Evening I viſit the <hi>Hoſpitals,</hi> which are the fineſt that ever I ſaw in the World, and I believe the beſt govern'd. There is one named, <hi>the Hoſpital of God,</hi> where Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of <hi>Quality</hi> themſelves, and thoſe of the <hi>Firſt Rank,</hi> come every Evening, and wait on the ſick and the wounded, doing all the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102956:33"/>meaneſt Offices of Inferior Servants, and this with abundance of Tenderneſs and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. I have ſeen the Niceſt and Gayeſt Ladies of the <hi>Court,</hi> dreſſing the moſt ſqualid and putrefied Sores of Wounded Men, not ſeeming in the leaſt to be diſguſted at the loathſom Sight and Stench of their Ulcers. When one firſt enters the Place, one would imagine it to be a Chamber of Young <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries;</hi> it being a very long and wide Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, with Rows of Beds on both ſides, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Sick are diſpoſed according to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their coming, or the Nature of their Diſeaſe. The Curtains of the Beds are all of pure white Linen, prettily wrought here and there with Flowers of Needle-Work. Their Sheets as white as the Curtains; and by each Bed ſtands a Baſon of clean Water, and a fine Towel lying by it. At the farther End of the Gallery, ſtands an Altar railed in, where the <hi>Prieſts</hi> perform their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Myſteries for the Sick. In fine, all Things in this Place ſpeak an Exquiſite <hi>Decorum</hi> and Order, with a generous Regard to the Health and Life of Man. Three of theſe Galleries make up the whole <hi>Hoſpital,</hi> and it is as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to me ſometimes to walk up and down in them, as in a beautiful Garden.</p>
                  <p>Certainly, if any Argument could be of Force to recommend Sickneſs as a deſirable Thing, it muſt be taken from the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this <hi>Hoſpital,</hi> or, an Equivalent Ground. I, for my own part, have often thought, That Death it ſelf would not be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102956:34"/>formidable amidſt ſo many Ornaments, Sweets and Comforts. If this Publick and Charitable Regard to the Sick, be an Effect of their Religion, I cannot be ſo partial to deny it a due Acknowledgment; but muſt own, That Heroick Vertue and Piety is to be found in an eminent Degree, even among the very <hi>Infidels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou wilt pardon me for detaining thee ſo long in the Theatre of the Sick and Wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and preſenting thee with the Tragical Scenes of Mortality; ſince it is thy proper Profeſſion, to converſe with the Infirmities, Diſeaſes and Dolors of Humane Bodies, and to be frequently preſent in the Anti-Chambers of Death.</p>
                  <p>Suffer me to preſs thee to an Integrity of continual Love and Friendſhip between us. Let not Miſtakes or Miſapprehenſions, cool this generous Affection. It is pity, That either the ſpightful Miſrepreſentations of inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating Back-biters, or, our own groundleſs Jealouſies and Suſpicions, ſhould diſſolve the Union of Faithful and Loving Friends. I had rather ſuffer a Thouſand ſmall Injuries, which I know muſt proceed from Frailty, and Humane Neceſſity, than not continue to Love where I have once pitch'd my true Affection. Nothing but apparent wilful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſneſs and Treachery, ought to break the ſacred and inviolable Band of Friendſhip. Fidelity and Love cover a multitude of leſſer Faults. He that breaks with his Friend for ſmall Errors, diſcovers the Raſhneſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy

For, had he been a Wiſe Man, he would either have been more ſlow and cautious in the choice of his Friend; or, having once contracted Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, he would not break it again for a leſs Crime than manifeſt Diſloyalty. But thou, who haſt ever purſued me with all the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of a Generous and Faithful Friend, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with my many Infirmities and Failings, doſt not deſerve this Cenſure. Yet, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Inſtability of all Humane Affairs, I could not forbear putting thee in Mind of theſe Things; leſt, through the Malice of Fortune, or the Envy of Men, or any other Cauſe thou ſhouldſt withdraw thy Affection from me, which I value above all Temporal Bleſſings. For, beſides the many Favours I have received at thy Hands, whereby I am obliged in Honour and Gratitude to love thee perpetually; a Spark of Natural, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Divine Affection was kindled in my Breaſt, from the firſt Time I converſed with thee; whether it proceeds from Agreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Harmony of Spirits, or ſome other ſecret Operation, I know not. But, ſure I am, and would have thee reſt confident, That there is not a Man in the World, who Loves and Honours thee with greater Fidelity than I do.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>To the</hi> Kaimacham.</head>
                  <p>I Take the beſt Meaſures for Intelligence, yet I cannot gain a Sight or a Copy of all the <hi>Expreſſes</hi> that come to this <hi>Court;</hi> nor can I learn their Import, as ſoon as they Arrive. The <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>State</hi> here, are the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres of News, they bury all in Silence.</p>
                  <p>This is the Reaſon, that I ſometimes have been forced to ſend thee an Account of many Events, long after they happened. My laſt Letter, was an Abſtract of the <hi>French</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> from the Beginning of the Year, to the <hi>Moon</hi> laſt paſt.</p>
                  <p>After the King of <hi>France</hi> had retired from the Camp before <hi>Perpignan,</hi> the <hi>Mareſchal de Meſleraye</hi> applied himſelf vigorouſly to perfect the <hi>Batteries, Redoubts,</hi> and other <hi>Works.</hi> Whilſt the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102956:35"/>perplexed with Cares and Anxieties, for this Important Place.</p>
                  <p>The Extremities to which it was reduc'd, haſtened his Preparations of an Effectual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. He ſent Orders to the <hi>Marquiſes</hi> of <hi>Terracuſe,</hi> of <hi>Leganez</hi> and <hi>Mortare,</hi> to raiſe the Flower of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Caſtile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Viceroy</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> furniſhed out a Conſiderable <hi>Fleet;</hi> it being the <hi>Catholick</hi> King's Reſolution, either to Succour <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pignan,</hi> and raiſe that Siege, or take <hi>Barce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona</hi> by Way of Reprizal.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, the new <hi>Mareſchal de la Mothe,</hi> fluſh'd with the late Favour he received from his Maſter, the <hi>French</hi> King, and ſpurred on with the Thirſt of Glory, entered like a Torrent with his Troops into <hi>Valentia,</hi> which at that time lay naked and unguarded.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Thing he did, was to ſurprize a Convoy of the <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Leganez,</hi> who were carrying an Extraordinary Piece of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non to <hi>Viveros.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> broke through the <hi>Foot,</hi> with their accuſtomed Fury, and killed more than Thirty Horſe, taking as many Priſoners. They ſent the Cannon to the Camp at <hi>Reoux.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou ſeeſt, Sage <hi>Miniſter,</hi> how neceſſary a Qualification it is in a Sovereign Prince, to diſcern and reward the Merits of his Servants. Men of Vertue are animated with freſh Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, when their Actions are acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Of this the ever Victorious <hi>Sultans</hi> of the <hi>Ottoman Empire</hi> are very ſenſible, who
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102956:36"/>value the Abilities and Services of their <hi>Slaves,</hi> before any Conſideration of <hi>Noble</hi> Blood or Riches; raiſing Men from Nothing, to the Higheſt Dignities of the <hi>Empire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mareſchal,</hi> after this Exploit, took the Towns of <hi>Tamarit,</hi> and <hi>Mouſon;</hi> but the Caſtle belonging to the latter, was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred upon Articles, the Fourteenth of the laſt <hi>Moon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilſt theſe things were tranſacted on the <hi>Land,</hi> the <hi>Navies</hi> were not Idle by <hi>Sea:</hi> The <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Breze</hi> ſet upon the <hi>Spaniſh Admiral,</hi> as he lay at Anchor near <hi>Viveros;</hi> and, not being able to diſingage the Veſſel from the Shallows, he ſet it on Fire, together with another of equal Burden.</p>
                  <p>This was only an Exploit by the by, and as it lay in his Road to <hi>Barcelona,</hi> where the whole <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet were Arrived, with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to Aſſault the Town by Sea.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Marquis de Breze,</hi> made all the Sail he could toward them; but, the Wind not favouring his Deſign, he was forced to make uſe of his Gallies. In a Word, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> loſt Four Ships in this Fight, and Three more on the Firſt of this <hi>Moon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Perpignan</hi> is in no likelihood of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. I will ſend thee all the Intelligence I receive of this Important Siege.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>To</hi> Iſouf <hi>his Kinſman.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>I Have received thy Letter, and congratulate thy ſafe Return to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The Bleſſing of <hi>Mahomet</hi> be upon thee, for the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> thou madeſt on <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in my behalf, and for the Alms thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt to blot out my Sins. Hadſt thou ſent me the <hi>Sacred Relique</hi> I deſired, I would mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply Benedictions on <hi>Iſouf</hi> my Couſin. It is but a trifling Excuſe to ſay, thou couldſt not procure that which is denied to no <hi>Pilgrim.</hi> The <hi>Emir</hi> of <hi>Mecca</hi> expects that every one who Viſits that <hi>Holy</hi> of <hi>Holies,</hi> ſhould pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe a Piece of the Old Hanging, when it is Yearly taken down. This is his Fee, and thou haſt at once defrauded him of his Due, fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated my Hopes, and weakned the Merit of thy <hi>Pilgrimage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, I will not be querelous; perhaps thou wert afraid of wanting Money in the Reſt of thy Journey. Thy Letter is very ſhort and full of Reſerves, hardly vouchſafing to make an Apology for thy long Silence, though it be now the Nine and Thirtieth <hi>Moon</hi> ſince thou firſt partedſt from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving me any Account what was become of thee.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes I thought thou wert over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd in the <hi>Sands</hi> of <hi>Arabia,</hi> or, that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102956:37"/>ſome wild Beaſt had devoured thee. At other times, I imagined thou might'ſt die of Thirſt, in thoſe dry and barren Deſarts. When the <hi>Caravan</hi> returned at the accuſtom'd Time, and no Tidings of <hi>Iſouf,</hi> I could not divine that thou wert gone into <hi>Perſia,</hi> or that thou wouldſt travel through all the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> as thy Letter informs me.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould be proud of my <hi>Kinſman,</hi> were I ſatisfied what Improvements he has made in ſo tedious a Journey. Thy Letter ſpeaks thee not a Traveller, thou art a Churle in not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating to me thy Adventures and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, in ſo many Countries as thou haſt paſs'd through.</p>
                  <p>Tell me <hi>Iſouf,</hi> what was the Motive which put thee upon ſuch a hazardous Fatigue? Thou wert a Man of great Faith to truſt thy ſelf to the Conduct of the <hi>Perſian,</hi> who invited thee along with him. It is a Sign thou haſt a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Soul, or elſe thou wouldſt not upon ſuch eaſie Terms have abandoned the Company of thy Fellow-travellers and Friends, to join thy ſelf to a Stranger, an Enemy to thy Nation, a <hi>Heretick.</hi> 'Tis true, a Peace was juſt then concluded between the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> and the <hi>Sophi</hi> of <hi>Perſia;</hi> and ſo there was no Danger of thy being ſnap'd for a Spy, and Sacrificed to the Jealouſie of <hi>State.</hi> But, thou expoſedſt thy ſelf to the <hi>Capricio's</hi> of Fortune, and the wavering Temper of a Man, who, for ought thou knoweſt, might have ſome ill Deſign upon thee.</p>
                  <p>Tell me, didſt not thou meet with great
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102956:37"/>Temptations at <hi>Iſpahan?</hi> couldſt thou with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Charms of <hi>Perſian</hi> Luxury? It muſt needs be a ſurprizing Novelty, to ſee the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the <hi>Court</hi> frolicking and revelling in the Houſes of Pleaſure without the City, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the auſtere Cuſtoms of our Women at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well! I will believe thee Chaſt in the midſt of Courtezans, ſober in Company of Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards; and, that the Spark who pick'd thee up at <hi>Medina,</hi> made no attempts to debauch thy Vertue; yet thou canſt not blame this Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, when thou conſidereſt the diſſolute Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of that Nation. And I will tell thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly, that I find it very irkſome to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from Wine, in a Country where every Body drinks it but my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But, thou giveſt me no Character of thy <hi>Perſian</hi> Friend, or his Quality. He might, for ought I know, be ſome <hi>Knight Errant,</hi> and thou his <hi>Squire,</hi> and ſo you rambled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether up and down <hi>Aſia</hi> to ſeek Adventures. For thou art not ſo complaiſant as to tell me the Effect of thy <hi>Travels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had I been in thy Place, I ſhould have made it my Buſineſs, to enquire into the Laws and Religions of thoſe Countries through which I paſs'd. I ſhould have taken Notice of the Strength and Situation of their Cities and Caſtles; Their Manner of Building and Fortifications; The Diſcipline of their Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; what Navigable Rivers they have, and which were the moſt eminent Places of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and Traffick.</p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:102956:38"/>
                  <p>When thou wert in the <hi>Court</hi> of the <hi>Great Mogul,</hi> it had been worth thy Obſervation, to ſee the Grandure of this <hi>Monarch,</hi> who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver goes into the Field with leſs than two hundred Thouſand Men. Thou ſhouldſt have remark'd alſo the Uſe the <hi>Indians</hi> make of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants</hi> in their Battels. It had not been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs to have caſt an Eye into their Temples in this Country, where thou wouldſt have beheld the Execrable Devotions of theſe <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,</hi> who worſhip the <hi>Devil</hi> under hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Forms. But above all, I ſhould have been greedy to ſee the <hi>Indian</hi> Women throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Funeral Pile after their dead Husbands. And, before I parted from the Country, I ſhould have ſought the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of their <hi>Gymnoſophiſts</hi> or <hi>Brachmans.</hi> Theſe are in ſo great Reputation for their Wiſdom, Sanctity, and Incorrupt Manners, that the greateſt <hi>Potentates</hi> have Recourſe to them in all Difficulties, as to <hi>Divine Oracles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>China</hi> alſo would have afforded thee Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Obſervation and Remark.</p>
                  <p>Theſe People ſay of themſelves, that they ſee with both Eyes, the <hi>Mahometans</hi> with one, and all the reſt of the World are ſtark blind. But in my Opinion, the <hi>Chineſes</hi> can be but pur-blind themſelves, ſince they ſee no farther than the Mountains which environ their own Country; it not being permitted to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of that <hi>Empire</hi> to travel. Yet, to give them their due, they are a very Ingenious People, envied by all the World for their Art in making <hi>Porphyry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:102956:38"/>
                  <p>I ſhould be glad to know, if whilſt thou wert in this Country, thou ever ſaweſt any of thoſe Sailing Wagons, which are ſaid to be uſed there.</p>
                  <p>It would be very obliging, to ſend me a particular Relation of thy Travels theſe three Years. Thou wilt not be angry, that I am ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous for thy Good. The End of Travelling, is, to gain Experience and Wiſdom. If thou haſt attained this, I ſhall rejoice. The deſire of Knowledge has cauſed many Famous Men to rome about the World. This led <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> into <hi>Paleſtine</hi> and <hi>Aegypt.</hi> This made <hi>Plato</hi> leave <hi>Athens,</hi> to go and learn of <hi>Archy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas</hi> the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> at <hi>Tarentum</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> And the ſame Motive, carried <hi>Apollonius</hi> through the greateſt part of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, I would not have thee confine thy Search to their Meaſures. For they only co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted to know the Myſteries of Nature. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, if thou travelleſt again, I would adviſe thee to acquaint thy ſelf with the Conſtitutions of Kingdoms and States, whereby thou mayſt be ſerviceable to our <hi>Great Maſter,</hi> the <hi>Grand Signior, Lord</hi> of the <hi>ſeven Clymates,</hi> for whoſe ſake the <hi>Elements</hi> are reſtrained within their <hi>Bounds,</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> it ſelf keeps on her Courſe.</p>
                  <p>Couſin, I pray the great <hi>God</hi> to poliſh thy Soul with Rational Principles, and make thee uſeful in thy Generation; for, no man is born for himſelf. Adieu.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>To</hi> Muſtapha Berber Aga, <hi>at</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.</head>
                  <p>I Sent thee a Letter in the Concluſion of the laſt Year, concerning the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and the Loſs of his Eſtate: Since which, he ſeems to have loſt himſelf; being <hi>Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated</hi> by the <hi>Pope,</hi> who is to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> what our <hi>Mufti</hi> is to <hi>true Believers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If thou knoweſt not what it is to be <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated</hi> by the <hi>Pope,</hi> I will inform thee in few Words.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who lie under this Cenſure, are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to enter into any of their <hi>Churches,</hi> or in the leaſt to partake of what they eſteem <hi>Holy.</hi> All <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> are commanded to ſhun their Company; they are eſteemed as bad as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks;</hi> baniſh'd humane Society, and given over to the <hi>Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Occaſion of paſſing this ſo ſevere a Sentence on a <hi>Sovereign</hi> Prince, thou wilt imagine was great; and yet, it was onely for putting away his firſt Wife, and marrying another. A Thing commonly practiſed all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> Should our <hi>Mufti's</hi> have the ſame Power, there would be but few <hi>Muſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> in the <hi>Sacred Moſques.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, theſe <hi>Infidels</hi> call Marriage a Great <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and eſteem it as violated when a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102956:39"/>Man repudiates his Wife; <hi>Divorces</hi> being not allowed in any Part of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> unleſs in Caſe of <hi>Adultery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>People talk variouſly of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Cenſure. Thoſe who favour the <hi>Counteſs</hi> of <hi>Cantecroix,</hi> murmur at the <hi>Excommunication,</hi> calling it, A Breach of Privileges, an unheard of Innovation, an Attempt upon the Life of the Prince. They add alſo, that he ought firſt to have been cited, and his Cauſe heard by the <hi>Court,</hi> according to the <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Decrees</hi> of <hi>Councils.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other Hand, there are who juſtifie this Proceeding of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and accuſe the <hi>Duke</hi> of barbarous Ingratitude, for leaving his Lawful Wife, by whom he got his Eſtate; and with whom he had lived many Years.</p>
                  <p>However, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> has pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd a <hi>Proteſtation</hi> againſt the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and cauſed his <hi>Procurator General</hi> to do the like; writing Letters alſo to the <hi>Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> and <hi>Counſellours</hi> of the <hi>Sovereign Court</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Barois,</hi> commanding them not to take any Notice of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Cenſure; it being actually null and void, becauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Fundamental Laws of the Church.</p>
                  <p>It is to be obſerved here, that this <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated</hi> Prince in the Concluſion of his <hi>Proteſt,</hi> appeals nevertheleſs to the Sovereign <hi>Biſhop,</hi> when he ſhall be better informed, ſtill profeſſing an Eternal Obedience to the <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a ſtrange unaccountable Power, the <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> claim over <hi>Emperours</hi> and <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:102956:40"/>In his publick Letters, Briefs or Patents, he ſtiles himſelf, <hi>the Servant of the Servants of God;</hi> yet, in his Actions, he aſſumes a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty</hi> over <hi>Kings,</hi> calling all the Princes in <hi>Chriſtendom, his Sons,</hi> and chaſtiſing them as ſuch, when he ſees Occaſion. All this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Difference they make between the Temporal and the Spiritual Sword. So, that when their Forces have been Routed, the City of <hi>Rome</hi> ſack'd, and themſelves taken Priſoners by the Force of the former; yet they have at the ſame Time, by the Dint of the latter, ſubdued their Conquerours, and in the midſt of Captivity celebrated a Triumph.</p>

                  <p>ART thou alive, Venerable Old Man, or muſt I expect my Anſwer in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World? I have often writ to thee, and more often enquired after thy Health, when I had Opportunity; but have received no Anſwer, nor heard any News of thee theſe Seven <hi>Moons;</hi> which ſeem ſo many Years, to a Man who would be ready to die for Joy, could he receive the leaſt Aſſurance that thou art yet alive.</p>
                  <p>Without Doubt, thou liveſt where-ever thou art, and liveſt in perfect Joy and Peace, the Rewards of thy conſummate Sanctity and Vertue. Either thou ſtill enjoyeſt a Heaven on Earth, thy Incorrupt Soul being a <hi>Paradiſe</hi> to it ſelf; or, thou haſt tranſlated thy Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from Earth to Heaven, to augment the Number and Joys of the <hi>Bleſſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well! I will ſuppoſe and hope thou art a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and that this Letter will come to thy Hand: I will therefore make thee an accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Preſent.</p>
                  <p>Thou haſt often ſpoke with much Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Reverence of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Meſſias</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as all Good <hi>Muſſulmen</hi>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:102956:41"/>ought to do; being taught by the <hi>Alcoran</hi> in ſeveral <hi>Chapters,</hi> that he was a <hi>Holy Prophet,</hi> and in the Number of the <hi>Divine</hi> Favorites.</p>
                  <p>I have met with an Authentick Deſcription of his Perſon in the King's Library, and have tranſlated it into <hi>Arabick</hi> for thy Satisfaction. <hi>Publius Lentulus</hi> being <hi>Preſident</hi> of <hi>Judea,</hi> ſent it to the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> when the Fame of <hi>Jeſus</hi> began to ſpread abroad in the World. Theſe are his Words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>THERE lives at this Time in</hi> Judaea, <hi>a Man of ſingular Vertue, whoſe Name is</hi> Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Whom the</hi> Barbarians <hi>eſteem a</hi> Prophet; <hi>but, his own Followers adore him as the</hi> Off-ſpring <hi>of the</hi> Immortal Gods. <hi>He calls back the Dead from their Graves, and heals all Sorts of Diſeaſes with a Word or a Touch. He is tall and well-ſhaped; of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable, Reverend Aſpect; his Hair of a Colour that can hardly be match'd, falling into Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Curls below his Ears, and very agreeably couching on his Shoulders, parted on the Crown of the Head like the</hi> Nazarites. <hi>His Fore-head is ſmooth and large, his Cheeks without other Spot, ſave that of a lovely Red. His Noſe and Mouth form'd with exquiſite Symmetry. His Beard thick, and of a Colour ſuitable to the Hair of his Head, reaching an Inch below his Chin, and parting in the middle like a Fork. His Eyes bright, clear and ſerene. He rebukes with Majeſty, counſels with Mildneſs; his whole Addreſs, whether in Word or Deed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Elegant and Grave. No Man has ſeen
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:102956:41"/>him laugh, but he has wept frequently. He is very Temperate, Modeſt and Wiſe. A Man, for his Excellent Beauty and Divine Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſurpaſſing the Children of Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſend thee this <hi>Picture</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtians Meſſias,</hi> not drawn by the Pencil of the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but by the Pen of a <hi>Roman</hi> Governour, and therefore it may paſs for Authentick. I have often heard thee praiſe the <hi>Original,</hi> and condemn ſome too Superſtitious <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> who, in their miſtaken Zeal for the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> have Blaſphem'd this <hi>Holy Prophet;</hi> a Man whom the <hi>Alcoran</hi> it ſelf mentions in ſeveral <hi>Chapters,</hi> ſtyling him, <hi>The Breath and Word of</hi> God.</p>
                  <p>Certainly, Malediction becomes not the Mouth of a <hi>True Believer;</hi> and he, who Curſes <hi>God,</hi> or any of the Hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four Thouſand <hi>Prophets,</hi> ſhall be excluded their Society in <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I give thee a final Adieu, O Holy <hi>Derviſe;</hi> deſiring, that this Character of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> may be tranſcribed in Letters of Gold on Silken Paper, and laid up in the <hi>Library</hi> of thy <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</hi> Adieu. Live for ever.</p>

                  <p>VArious are the Diſcourſes of People in this Place concerning the Reduction of <hi>Aſac.</hi> For, <hi>Paris,</hi> like <hi>Athens</hi> of old, is the Receptacle of all the News in the World.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> are Naturally a <hi>Martial</hi> People, delighting much in the Affairs of <hi>War;</hi> and when the News came laſt Year of the Raiſing the Siege of <hi>Aſac,</hi> with all the Particulars of the Defendants Bravery, notwithſtanding the Union of ſo great Forces againſt them; they highly applauded the Valour and Conſtancy of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> whom neither Threats nor Promiſes, gentle Means, nor vigorous Aſſaults could prevail upon to ſurrender up their Town, but forced the Beſiegers to return Home with the Loſs of above Twelve Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Turks,</hi> beſides <hi>Moldavians, Walachians,</hi> and <hi>Tartars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now they begin to change their Notes, and to admire the <hi>Invincible</hi> Force of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Arms, which hew their way through the moſt Formidable Difficulties, to lay <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>States</hi> at the Feet of our <hi>Victorious Sultan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have received a particular Account from <hi>Nathan Ben Saddi,</hi> of the taking of that City. He tells me, That at the News of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:102956:42"/>thoſe great Preparations, which were making by Land and Sea againſt it; the Inhabitants being denied the Protection of the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> which was their ſole Refuge in this Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, abandoned the Town, carrying with them their Goods, and demoliſhing their Houſes, ſo that there was but ſmall Prey left for our Soldiers.</p>
                  <p>It is the General Diſcourſe of this <hi>Court,</hi> that there is a Son born to <hi>Sultan Ibrahim.</hi> I ſhould heartily rejoice, were I aſſured the News were true; but, there is no <hi>Diſpatch</hi> as yet to confirm it. Beſides, I have received Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which almoſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages me from ever hoping ſo fortunate an Event.</p>

                  <p>THOU haſt no Reaſon to repine at the Exchange of thy <hi>Government,</hi> though thy preſent Power be circumſcribed within narrower Limits than it was in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> That <hi>Granary</hi> of the World, never afforded thee ſuch a Harveſt of Laurels as thou haſt reaped on the Banks of the <hi>Black-Sea.</hi> The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Aſac</hi> has loaded thee with Honours, and the Moderation thou haſt in the midſt of Triumphs, has captivated greater Numbers of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> than could the Dint of thy Cymetar. Though the Foundations of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms are laid in Blood, yet the Superſtructure is cemented with Clemency; and, the <hi>Roman Caeſars,</hi> by timely ſheathing their Swords, faſtned to their <hi>Empire,</hi> the Provinces they had won by drawing them.</p>
                  <p>I am bound to write often to the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Port,</hi> and all my Moments are conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to the Service of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> who has a Right to command all Mankind: Yet the Fame of thy late Victory reaching theſe Parts, and giving occaſion of Diſcourſe, I ſtole this time from my ſelf, not from my <hi>Great Maſter</hi> (it being the Hour of Sleep) to tell thee what the World ſays of thee.</p>
                  <p>They do not compare thee to <hi>Hannibal, Scipio,</hi> or <hi>Alexander the Great;</hi> thou thy
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102956:43"/>ſelf wouldſt take him for a Flatterer, that ſhould uſe ſuch an Expreſſion. But they ſay, the Method thou haſt taken, to ſweeten the Calamities of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> and invite them back to their abandoned Habitations, has ſome reſemblance with the Conduct of <hi>Selim,</hi> a <hi>General</hi> of <hi>Orchanes</hi>'s Army; who, after he had taken the City of <hi>Pruſa,</hi> forbid his Soldiers, on pain of Death, to touch the Goods of the Inhabitants, or commit any Inſolent Action. The Moderation of this Conqueror, not only rendred the Citizens eaſie, and willing to ſubmit to their <hi>New Lord;</hi> but, the Fame of it ſpreading abroad, he with little Bloodſhed reduced all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining Countrys under Subjection.</p>
                  <p>It is reported of the Great and Victorious <hi>Saladine,</hi> That he took more Pleaſure in winning the Hearts of his Enemies, than in conquering their Perſons. This Prince had a Saying very common in his Mouth, <hi>That he did the Office of a Barber and Gardiner, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Superfluities, and pruning the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcencies of Overgrown Kingdoms and States, not deſtroying them Root and Branch.</hi> 'Tis certain, he endeavoured in all his Conqueſts to mollify the Averſion of his Enemies, by Acts of Generoſity.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt expect ſome News from a Man in my Poſt, and I cannot entertain thee with more agreeable Intelligence, than what is the common Theme of Diſcourſe at this Time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Edward, Duke</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi> has entered into the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Territories with Three Thouſand
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:102956:44"/>ſelect Horſe, where he marches Dragooning up and down the Country, bringing Terror and Confuſion where-ever he comes. He Conquers without drawing his Sword, the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Army flying before him.</p>
                  <p>This Prince is by Nature very Fierce and Active, and has a peculiar Gift of obliging his Souldiers, by treating them with a frank, affable Carriage, free from the ſtately Reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedneſs to which Men in Authority are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed. By this Deportment, he has inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſtole their Affections; they are ready to follow him all over the World.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi> fall out with one another, they generally engage the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the Quarrel. But the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi> refuſed the Aſſiſtance which the former profer'd him of Two Thouſand Men, provided they might be diſpoſed in Garriſons; he was Jealous, leſt the <hi>French</hi> deſign'd to play their old Game; and, that when they were once Houſed in his Cities and ſtrong Holds, it would be difficult to Unkennel them.</p>
                  <p>He has a new way of winning Towns, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying with him neither Infantry, Cannon, Ammunition, nor any other Proviſion ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to a <hi>Campaign.</hi> Yet, when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached towards <hi>Smola</hi> in his Road to <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna,</hi> the Governour ſent the Keys of the Town to him in his March; which he made no other uſe of, than to give his Troops a Paſſage through the Place, reſigning them up again. By theſe Noble Acts, he paved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an eaſie Way through the <hi>Eccleſiaſtick</hi>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:102956:44"/>State; his Army being furniſhed with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals in Abundance, without Plunder or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolency.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Occaſion of this Quarrel, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from ſome Contempts put upon the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Parma</hi> at the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the Nephews of <hi>Pope <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban.</hi> And, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſts have ſince been improved to that Height, as to Engage the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> the <hi>Grand Duke</hi> of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Modena,</hi> and other <hi>Princes,</hi> in the Care of the General In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They proceed with Mediations and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Peace in one Hand, while the Sword is brandiſh'd with the other; amuzing one another with Treaties to gain Time. The Loſs of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> a ſtrong Town on the Borders of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtick State,</hi> ſpurs on the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Parma</hi> to Revenge himſelf on the <hi>Barbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini's;</hi> while the <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> ſtrives to mitigate his Fierceneſs, and accommodate Affairs, eſpouſing his Cauſe, but fearful of his Raſhneſs, leſt his impetuous Humour ſhould carry him to the Walls of <hi>Rome,</hi> and bring things to Extremities. For, all the Princes in <hi>Italy</hi> profeſs an Inviolate Obedience to the <hi>Pope,</hi> who ſeems to Inherit the Authority of the Ancient <hi>Roman Emperours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou maiſt comprehend by what I have ſaid, how eaſie it were at ſuch a Juncture (when all the <hi>Principalities</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> are (as it were) disjointed) to bring them under the Yoke of a <hi>Foreign</hi> Power. This is what the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>French</hi> have for a long time
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:102956:45"/>been nibling at: and, whereof the <hi>Rebublick</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> are ſo Jealous, that they never ſide with one Party to the Ruine of another, but endeavour to keep all the Intereſts of <hi>Italy</hi> in an <hi>Aequilibrium,</hi> till they are Reconciled and United, leſt the Party which finds it ſelf moſt weakned, ſhould ſeek the Protection of one of thoſe Potent Crowns; who would not fail to ſtrike two ſtrokes for themſelves, if they are deſired to ſtrike one for the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed <hi>Italian.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>If the Stratagem by which they deſign'd to take this Town, be truly related to me, it ſeems to be a Copy of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Artifice in taking <hi>Troy,</hi> bating the Difference of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Carts, and one Wooden Horſe.</p>
                  <p>That Officer who diſcovered the Intrigue; tho' he had hunted in vain all the former part of the Day, yet returned with good Game at laſt, when he had enſnared our carted Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers within the Toils, got them within the Walls of the City, and drawn up the Draw-Bridge upon the Ambuſh which lay behind. The <hi>Emperor,</hi> it ſeems takes it mightily to heart; and, as I hear, has ſent an <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> to the <hi>Port,</hi> to complain of this Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Court</hi> here, is not very ſolicitous for his Intereſt, nor will they be much troubled to find that his <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> has but a cold Reception at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> For, the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences

I ſweat while I am within the Confines of the Air of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> An uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Peſtilence infects the Souls of Men, from whence their Words breath nothing but Contagion. Even ſuch as one would take for <hi>Holy Saints,</hi> are <hi>meer Cheats;</hi> and, like thoſe Fruits that grow on the Banks of the Lake <hi>Aſphaltites,</hi> they are fair and beautiful without, but bring them to the Touchſtone, and you will find them meer Corruption and Rottenneſs within. The <hi>Laity</hi> openly wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in all Debauchery and Licentious Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Nor are the <hi>Clergy</hi> leſs exempt from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Enormities; while the <hi>Eccleſiaſtick</hi> Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſerve but as Cloaks to Pride, Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Covetouſneſs, and other concomitant Vices. The Sword of <hi>Juſtice</hi> it ſelf, or at leaſt, that which ought to be ſo, ſerves to divide the Spoils of the <hi>Poor,</hi> the <hi>Widow</hi> and the <hi>Orphan.</hi> In <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Camp</hi> all Offices are bought and ſold, without regard to Merit or the Publick Good. He that bids higheſt, is firſt preferr'd; and, the beſt-mony'd Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, is the moſt meritorious <hi>Candidate.</hi>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:102956:47"/>Theſe are the Eſcapes of Princes, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of Favourites; whilſt the Eaſineſs of the one, abuſed by the Craft and Subtilty of the other, expoſes Places of higheſt Truſt, as in an Exchange, to become the Merchandize of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pedling Huckſter; And brave and gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Souls are many Times put by, tho' the <hi>Royal</hi> Promiſe it ſelf has paſs'd in their Behalf. This is eminently the Unhappineſs of the <hi>French Court.</hi> And, 'tis thought, the late <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Luynes</hi> and the preſent <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> both of them Favourites to the preſent King, could not have ſwell'd their Coffers with ſuch Heaps of Gold, but by theſe ſiniſter Methods.</p>
                  <p>I am credibly Informed by an old <hi>French</hi> Courtier, That <hi>Monſieur Belville,</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> ſpared not to paſs this Reflection on the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Luynes,</hi> even in the King's Preſence. Being at <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi> while the King celebrated his Nuptials with the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> in a moſt Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Manner; one Day coming to the <hi>Court</hi> in his <hi>Mourning</hi>-Coach, (his Father being new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dead) he was reprehended by <hi>Monſieur Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinet,</hi> Younger Brother to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Luynes,</hi> for appearing at <hi>Court</hi> in ſuch an extraordinary Time of Joy, with a <hi>Mourning</hi>-Coach. <hi>O, Sir,</hi> ſays <hi>Belville, the Bravery of your Brother's Coach, may excuſe the Meanneſs of mine, ſince he borrowed all the Gold I had, to Equipp him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for this Triumphant Seaſon.</hi> This I was told, by one that was preſent and heard the Words; and, the Occaſion of them alſo he was not ignorant of, which was this:</p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:102956:47"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Monſieur Belville</hi> being a Gentleman of a <hi>Noble</hi> Family, and one whoſe eminent Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Services might have intituled him to ſome ſuitable Dignity, but being low in his Fortune, was not regarded or taken Notice of, till he addreſſed himſelf to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Luynes;</hi> who, upon the Receipt of Fifteen Hundred Crowns, promiſed him to make him <hi>Cavalier</hi> of the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> a Dignity next to that of the <hi>Peers</hi> of the <hi>Realm,</hi> and which is a fair Step to it. But, inſtead of performing his Promiſe, after he had got his Money, he by under-hand Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, procured him to be baniſhed the <hi>Court,</hi> neither did he ever come near it till this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage aforeſaid was taken in Hand; at which time his Father dying at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there alſo buried, he by the Mediation of ſome Friend, procured a Repeal of his <hi>Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that he might have an Opportunity of making the King ſenſible of the <hi>Duke</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice. But, it took not the deſired Effect; for, he was upon thoſe Words, immediately impriſoned, where he ſoon after died of Grief. Thus is Oppreſſion, Murder, and Violence countenanc'd by Authority among theſe <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.</hi>

                  <p>THE Enemies of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Intereſt, ever ſince the Time that our late <hi>Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Sultan Amurat</hi> had cauſed his Uncle <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtapha</hi> to be ſtrangled, flatter'd themſelves with the vain Hopes, of ſeeing that <hi>Royal Line</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct; it being blaz'd abroad in all the <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> that <hi>Sultan Amurat,</hi> by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Uſe of Wine, had quite enervated his Natural Vigor, and rendred himſelf incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of getting any more Children. And the private Charge which he gave to the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s and <hi>Grandees</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> That in Caſe he died Iſſueleſs, they ſhould tranſlate the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Diadem</hi> to the <hi>Tartar,</hi> was no Secret here. Every Man look'd upon our preſent Happy Sovereign, <hi>Sultan Ibrahim,</hi> as a Man deſign'd for a Sacrifice to his Brother's Hatred, and that he would not long ſurvive the Fate of his Uncle <hi>Muſtapha.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have heard a grave and experienc'd States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſay, that he hoped to ſee the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire (after the Death of <hi>Amurat</hi>) rent into as many and fatal Diviſions, by the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious <hi>Beglerbegs, Baſſa's</hi> and other Gove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of Provinces, as the <hi>Empire</hi> of <hi>Alexander the Great</hi> was, by the Commanders of his

                  <p>But, Praiſe be to <hi>God, Lord</hi> of the <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Birth of <hi>Sultan Mahomet</hi> is no ſmall News to <hi>Europe,</hi> after it had been generally reported, that his Father, <hi>Sultan Ibrahim,</hi> was Impotent. The Ladies of the <hi>Court</hi> here begin to entertain a better Opinion of him. And the <hi>Grandees</hi> frame more Maſculine <hi>Idea's</hi> of our <hi>Glorious Monarch.</hi>

                  <head>To the ſame.</head>
                  <p>IT is not lawful for a <hi>Slave</hi> to pry into the Actions of his <hi>Sovereign Lord,</hi> much leſs to cenſure his Conduct with Boldneſs. But, miſerable is that Prince who amongſt all his pretended Friends and Servants, has none ſo Faithful and Diſcreet, as to warn him of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which are ready to devour him.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but highly applaud the Severity of thy Juſtice, in taking away the Life of that <hi>Perſian</hi> Traytor laſt Year, who by his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Inſinuations and Example, haſtened the Death of our late <hi>Victorious Sovereign, Sultan Amurat,</hi> upon whom be the <hi>Mercies</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That <hi>Heretick,</hi> though an <hi>Emir,</hi> of the Race of our <hi>Holy Prophet,</hi> and adorned with the <hi>Immarceſcible Colour,</hi> which is appropriated to Sanctity and Vertue; yet, refrained not from <hi>Idolatry,</hi> being a daily Votary to <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</hi> He it was, who firſt taught the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Sultan</hi> to drink Wine, which he afterwards practiſed to that Exceſs, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd him to many Inconveniences, and at laſt to Death it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But, ſuffer me to ask thee, why thou doſt not alſo take an equal Revenge on <hi>Muſtapha Baſſa,</hi> who was as guilty as the <hi>Perſian;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only a Companion, but a zealous Promoter of the <hi>Royal</hi> Debauches? It was he,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102956:52"/>who firſt propos'd that Fatal Match of drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which caſt the <hi>Sultan</hi> into a Mortal Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, of which he died in leſs than a Week.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould not preſume to ſay theſe Things to thee, nor to call paſt Miſcarriages to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, were I not certainly inform'd that the ſame <hi>Muſtapha</hi> is practiſing his old Trade with the preſent <hi>Sultan Ibrahim,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to enervate the <hi>Royal</hi> Blood, and withdraw the <hi>Sultan</hi> from the juſt Obſervance of our <hi>Holy Law,</hi> to the Impious Prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Infidels.</hi> I am commanded to give Intelligence of all Important Affairs to thee, and the other <hi>Great Miniſters</hi> of <hi>State:</hi> I thought none more weighty, than that which Regards the Life of my <hi>Sovereign.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have done my Duty, I leave the Proceſs to thee, who art the Oracle of Government.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>I Received the <hi>Diſpatch</hi> of thy <hi>Sanctity,</hi> wherein thou haſt renovated my <hi>Soul,</hi> and reſtored me to a ſound Conſiſtence of <hi>Spirit.</hi> My Doubts are vaniſhed, I am no longer racked with torturing Scruples about my Conduct. Thy <hi>Abſolution</hi> has obliterated the <hi>Sentence</hi> my Fears had pronounced on me.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Penance</hi> thou haſt enjoined me, it is Rational, and adapted to the Quality of my Crime. I have counterfeited a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> that I might the better perform the Duty of a <hi>Muſſulman.</hi> I have ſeemed devoutly At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to the <hi>Roman Miſſal,</hi> that I might be Inſtrumental to propagate the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> And, for this <hi>Religious</hi> Fault, thou requireſt, that I ſhould inform thee, how the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themſelves in their <hi>Temples,</hi> where I have been ſo often a Spectator of their <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</hi> I ſubmit with an abſolute Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a willing Compliance to thy <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> Injunction; and, will briefly relate what I have obſerved.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Infidels</hi> ſeem to be Ambitious of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndefiled Religion,</hi> and yet they proved but bad <hi>Mimicks;</hi> for, as we are taught to waſh our Bodies before we enter the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102956:53"/>Moſque;</hi> ſo they, at the Entrance of their <hi>Churches,</hi> dip their Fingers in certain Veſſels filled with Water and Salt, and ſprinkle their Foreheads therewith; as though their Purity lay in a Swound, and was thus to be recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to life again: or, that the Uncleanneſs of their whole Bodies, were contracted into the Face. They eſteem the Water <hi>Holy,</hi> and yet they trifle with it as an <hi>Indifferent</hi> Thing. One would think, they ſhould be deſirous to bath themſelves all over, and let every Pore in their Skin imbibe the <hi>Sanctified</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor: But, they ſeem rather to uſe it as a Charm; for, after they have ſprinkled a few Drops on their Faces, and muttered to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Two or Three Words, they think they have chaſed all Impurity from them in a Fright, and boldly preſent themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Altars.</hi> Herein alſo they deviate from the Practice of Former <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who (if their own <hi>Church-Hiſtories</hi> be true) were accuſtomed to waſh their Arms and Feet in certain Ciſterns, before they entred the <hi>Temples;</hi> whereof the <hi>Fountains</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatories</hi> remaining yet on the <hi>South</hi> Side of the <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Magnificent Moſque</hi> of <hi>Sancta So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> are a ſtanding Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. For, the <hi>Greek</hi> Inſcriptions ſhew That ſome of them, at leaſt, were contrived by the Builders of this Glorious <hi>Temple,</hi> in the Time of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the <hi>Emperor,</hi> for the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification of ſuch as came thither to Worſhip. By which 'tis manifeſt, That theſe <hi>Modern In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels</hi> degenerate from thoſe more <hi>Ancient</hi> ones.</p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:102956:54"/>
                  <p>Another Thing offends me alſo, which is this; They believe the <hi>Divinity</hi> is preſent in their <hi>Temples,</hi> after a peculiar and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Manner, and yet they ſuffer Dogs to Prophane them with their vileſt Excrements. They ſpare for no Coſt to adorn their <hi>Churches,</hi> and their <hi>Altars</hi> are enriched with invaluable Treaſures of Silver, Gold, and Precious Stones; and yet, after all, they muſt become the Receptacles of the Dung of Sordid A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals.</p>
                  <p>Theſe wicked Wretches alſo, walk up and down in theſe <hi>Sacred Places,</hi> talking of their Common Affairs, as though they were on the <hi>Exchange,</hi> or in the <hi>Market-Place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, that which is to be had in greateſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination, is, that it is common for Men to make Love to the Women in <hi>Churches:</hi> They preſent themſelves before the <hi>Altars,</hi> but, the <hi>Saint</hi> whom they Invocate, is ſome beautiful Female. She engroſſes all their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions; to her they make their Vows. The amorous Youth adores his Miſtreſs that kneels by him, laden perhaps with more Sins than himſelf. His Eyes may be fixed on the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> or, on the Pictures and Images, but his Tongue Addreſſes to the more Charming Idol near him: Or, if his Eyes are attentive on his <hi>Prayer-Book,</hi> he teaches it to ſpeak nothing but the ſoft and effeminate Things of Love. Thus, Aſſignations of <hi>Luſt,</hi> are made in the <hi>Houſe of Prayer;</hi> and the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of <hi>Cupid,</hi> managed under the Maſque of <hi>Religion.</hi> They Fight the Battels of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:102956:54"/>under the Banner of their <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I tell thee, <hi>Venerable Interpreter</hi> of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law,</hi> that the Sight of theſe Things has ſometimes enflamed my Zeal to that Height, as had it not been for an earneſt Deſire to do ſome extraordinary Service to the <hi>Grand Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnior</hi> (which obliged me to take Care of my ſelf) I ſhould certainly have transfixt theſe prophane Mockers of <hi>God</hi> on the Spot, and Sacrificed them to a Zeal, which thou, who art <hi>Piety</hi> it ſelf, wouldſt not, I believe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend.</p>
                  <p>I fold my Arms, <hi>moſt Venerable Sovereign of Religion,</hi> and wrapping my ſelf in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Humily, I fall proſtrate to the Earth; begging thy effectual Bleſſing and Interceſſion, that I may be admitted into the Number of the <hi>Happy</hi> in <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>

                  <head>LETTER XXIV.</head>
                  <head>To the <hi>Vizir Azem,</hi> Prime Director of the Affairs of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</head>
                  <p>THE Notices I have of the <hi>Preſent State</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> (in Compliance with thy Commands) are not gained without ſome Difficulty. It is not eaſie for a Man that ſits in his Chamber in <hi>Paris,</hi> to pry into the Cabinets of <hi>Foreign Courts:</hi> Yet, I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to thee ſome Intelligences, which thou couldſt not learn from the <hi>Engliſh Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador</hi> at the <hi>Port,</hi> nor from all the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellours of that Nation, reſiding at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, Smyrna</hi> and <hi>Aleppo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a <hi>Jew</hi> whom they call <hi>De Lopez,</hi> a Confident and Emiſſary of <hi>Cardinal Richlieu,</hi> whom he employs both at Home and Abroad in ſeveral private Negotiations and Intrigues. I have inſinuated into this Man's Familiarity, and (if I may ſo expreſs it) I have Riveted my ſelf into his Heart. He treats me with an Aſſurance void of Jealouſie; and, there is no Folding or Angle in his Breaſt, which I do not eaſily penetrate. I make uſe of him, as an <hi>Optick,</hi> through which I peep into the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s Secrets, and, as a Mirrour, in which I behold the true Face of many diſguiſed Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, tranſacted in the remoteſt Corners of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102956:55"/>
                     <hi>Europe;</hi> there being hardly any thing of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment done in the <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes, wherein the <hi>Cardinal</hi> has not a Finger. He ſeems to be the <hi>Genius</hi> or <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> communicating Motion, Activity, and Heat, to all the Grand Intrigues now on Foot in theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts of the World.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Commotions</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> ſeem to be a <hi>complicated Diſtemper</hi> of the <hi>State,</hi> ariſing from ſeveral <hi>Cauſes,</hi> drawn to a <hi>Head</hi> by the dextrous Artifice of this <hi>Buſie Spirit.</hi> The Preſent King of that <hi>Iſland,</hi> came to the Crown with no ſmall Diſadvantages; his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther having Exhauſted the <hi>Treaſury,</hi> and left him deeply in Debt. he had no ſmall Number of the <hi>Blood-Royal</hi> to maintain; which kind of Charges, thou knoweſt, our <hi>Glorious Sultans,</hi> though they be Maſters of infinite Riches, endeavour to avoid, by Marrying their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Nieces, whilſt yet Infants, to ſome of the moſt Potent and Wealthy <hi>Baſſa's,</hi> that ſo their Port may be kept up, without burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Royal</hi> Coffers. But, the <hi>Infidel</hi> Princes are wanting in this frugal Providence. In the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> (this King's Father) <hi>England</hi> lay at Eaſe, ſlumbring in the Downy Bed of Peace; ſhe wallowed in Pleaſures, and had no other Unhappineſs, but in being too Happy. Her Affluence and Idleneſs, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the <hi>State</hi> with a <hi>Plethory.</hi> The Publick Health cannot be long conſerved, without the moderate Exerciſe of War. <hi>Charles,</hi> after the Death of the <hi>Old King,</hi> being Eſtabliſhed in the <hi>Throne,</hi> committed the Affairs of <hi>State,</hi>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:102956:56"/>to the Management of his <hi>Miniſters;</hi> never examining his <hi>Treaſury,</hi> nor calling to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count his <hi>Officers,</hi> but Indulged himſelf in the Pleaſures moſt agreeable to his Youthful <hi>Genius.</hi> He hunted in the Foreſts, whilſt the <hi>Grandees,</hi> whom he entruſted with his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues and the Publick Conduct, had another Game to purſue poſt-poning their Maſter's Intereſt, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> of the Nation, to their own private Avarice. The <hi>Favourite Miniſter,</hi> held a ſecret Correſpondence with <hi>Cardinal Richlieu,</hi> and, by this means, the <hi>Court</hi> was filled with <hi>French Penſioners;</hi> countenanced alſo by the Authority of the <hi>Queen,</hi> who was the <hi>Daughter</hi> of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It had been before agreed in the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Marriage,</hi> that the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>England</hi> ſhould have a prefixed Number of <hi>French</hi> Servants. But they, not content with their Domeſtick Employments, and Attendance on her Perſon, ſought the Management of that Eſtate, which King <hi>Charles</hi> had ſetled on her as a <hi>Dowry.</hi> This would by no means agree with the Conſtitutions of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> That <hi>Iſland</hi> is a <hi>Little World</hi> by it ſelf; and, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants boaſt of an Original Freedom of Birth, which is not ſo much as dreamt of in all the Dominions of our <hi>Invincible Sultans.</hi> Though the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have ſeveral Times been Invaded and Subdued, by the <hi>Saxons, Danes,</hi> and <hi>French;</hi> yet, it has been rather by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition than Extremity of War: Or, if it may be called a <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> the <hi>Victors</hi> have been forced to yield to the <hi>Vanquiſhed,</hi> in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102956:56"/>them their Ancient Laws, Privileges and Cuſtoms. There is no Nation in the World, more jealous of this their pretended Birthright. And therefore to avoid all Occaſions of giving Offence to the <hi>Nobles</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> perceiving the inſolent Demands and Carriage of the <hi>French Courtiers,</hi> commanded them all, ſave a few Creatures of the <hi>Favourite Duke,</hi> to depart the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> This much diſguſted the <hi>Queen;</hi> and <hi>Cardinal Richlieu</hi> was glad of the Opportunity to incenſe the King of <hi>France. Lewis</hi> was netled at the Affront offered to his Siſter. Yet, by the Dexterity of the <hi>Mareſchal Baſſompierre,</hi> his <hi>Embaſſador</hi> at the <hi>Engliſh Court,</hi> Things were in a way of Accommodation; when all was quaſh'd by the Seizure which the <hi>French</hi> made of ſeveral <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships; and ſo a War com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, far more fatal in its Conſequences to <hi>England</hi> than to <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> rouzed from his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Divertiſements, by the Preparations of his Potent Neighbour, began to look about him, and conſult the Publick Safety. But, when he examined his <hi>Treaſury,</hi> he found it empty, or, at leaſt, at a very low Ebb.</p>
                  <p>Behold here, Supreme <hi>Baſſa,</hi> a ſtroke of <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> a Concurrence of Cauſes, ſeeming remote and ſmall in their firſt Appearance; but, in their Proceſs, uniting and involving that Kingdom in Ruine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Charles</hi> could not carry on a War with <hi>France,</hi> without asking Aid of the <hi>Sovereign Divan</hi> (which they call the <hi>Parliament</hi>)
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102956:57"/>of that Nation. It is a <hi>Senate</hi> compoſed of above Seven hundred of the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> of the Land. Theſe have the Power to make Laws, raiſe Taxes, and redreſs the Grievances of the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> It was an ill Seaſon to ask the Aſſiſtance of his <hi>Subjects,</hi> who had already conceived an Averſion for the <hi>Royal Dignity.</hi> However, a Mighty <hi>Fleet</hi> was order'd to be Rigg'd and Mann'd out. <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Richlieu,</hi> from afar, beheld the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Storm, and knew not how to divert it from falling on <hi>France,</hi> but by Corrupting the <hi>Engliſh Favourite. De Lopez,</hi> from whom I received this Intelligence, was employed in the Affair; he was ſent to <hi>London,</hi> which is the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and the Place where the King uſually keeps his <hi>Court.</hi> It was an Expenſive Negotiation, and coſt the <hi>Cardinal</hi> Forty Thouſand <hi>Dollars,</hi> which is equivalent to Three Millions and Two Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of our <hi>Aſpers.</hi> With this vaſt Bribe, he Proſelyted the <hi>Favourite Duke</hi> to the Intereſt of <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh Navy</hi> conſiſted of and Hundred and Fifty Sail, having alſo Twelve Thouſand Land-Men on Board. It was agreed between them, that the <hi>Engliſh Miniſter</hi> ſhould procure himſelf to be made <hi>Admiral</hi> of theſe <hi>Marine</hi> Forces. His Indulgent Maſter, could deny nothing to the Man whom he had entruſted with the Sway of the <hi>Government.</hi> Now the King of <hi>France</hi> might ſleep at quiet, ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships ſailed with a <hi>French</hi> Wind. They landed upon the <hi>Iſland</hi> of <hi>Ree,</hi> but their Actions were altogether <hi>Theatrical;</hi>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:102956:57"/>a mere ſhew of War, without any real Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. The <hi>Engliſh General,</hi> manifeſtly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the proper Methods, and favourable Opportunities of winning that <hi>Iſland:</hi> His Conduct ſpeaking, as if he came there rather to Complement than to Fight.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Things made a harſh ſound in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the <hi>Nobles</hi> reſented ill the double-dealing of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Buckingham</hi> (ſo was the <hi>Engliſh</hi> General call'd.) In fine, the bad Succeſs of their Forces, the Expences they had been at, and the Diſgrace they ſuffered in this War, (Four and Forty of their <hi>Colours</hi> being carried to <hi>Paris,</hi> and hung up in the Chief <hi>Temple</hi> of this City, as Trophies of the <hi>French</hi> Victory) incenſed the Generality of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation againſt the King and the Government; they began to accuſe him in their Cabals, of Male-Adminiſtration; and, the Favourite <hi>Duke</hi> was a while after ſtabbed by a Ruffian, whom the Malecontents had hired to execute their Revenge.</p>
                  <p>The Affections of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> appeared every day more and more alienated from the King. And <hi>Cardinal Richlieu</hi> had there his Agents, who were not wanting to foment the Publick Diſcontents, and by divers Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to draw the Credulous People into Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. The <hi>French Penſioners</hi> were inſtructed to deport themſelves in a Manner every way offenſive to the Nation. Black and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Clouds ſeemed to hang over the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> exhaled from the ill Blood of the <hi>Subjects.</hi> The <hi>Royal</hi> Dignity went Retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102956:58"/>and, all Things tended to obſcure the Luſtre of the Crown. Yet, there paſſed ſome Years, before Things came to Extremities; and, Matters, though ripened, yet were not brought to an open Rupture, till <hi>Scotland</hi> lanced the Sore.</p>
                  <p>This Nation is ſubject to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and makes one Half of the <hi>Iſland</hi> of <hi>Great Brittain.</hi> They are a Warlike People, patient of Labour, accuſtomed to the Rigour of an Extreme Cold <hi>Climate,</hi> great Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, Subtle, Proud and Inconſtant.</p>
                  <p>After that which ſome call <hi>Hereſie,</hi> others a <hi>Reformation,</hi> had begun to alienate many <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>Provinces</hi> from the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> greedy of Novelties, and ſpurred on by the Ambitious Pretexts of one of their <hi>Grandees</hi> (who under the Mask of Religion ſought the Crown) introduced In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations into their <hi>Church.</hi> They ſhook off at once all their <hi>Obedience</hi> to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and ſet up ſuch a <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Religious Diſcipline,</hi> as was altogether <hi>Antimonarchical;</hi> and, their <hi>Preachers</hi> ceaſed not to inſtill into the Hearts of the People, <hi>Democratick</hi> Principles. Thus continued Affairs, till King <hi>Charles,</hi> not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of theſe Things, and willing to new-Model that <hi>Church,</hi> they took up Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, knowing that he would not be able to raiſe Forces to chaſtiſe them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out calling a <hi>Parliament.</hi> The <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> was at that time full of <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Proſelytes, Men of Seditious and <hi>Turbulent</hi> Principles; ſo, that the <hi>King</hi> was like to find
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102956:58"/>but little Favour among them. However, by the Aſſiſtance of ſome Loyal <hi>Nobles</hi> and <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> he marches into <hi>Scotland</hi> at the Head of an Army. Not a Blow was ſtruck on either Side; but all Differences were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and huſh'd up by a <hi>Treaty.</hi> Yet, ſoon after, the <hi>Scots</hi> entred into <hi>England</hi> with an Army, being underhand invited in by their Partizans in <hi>England.</hi> The King is a Second Time forced to throw himſelf upon his <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> for Money; but they, inſtead of grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him any, fell to examining his paſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, complaining and deſiring a Redreſs of ſeveral Irregularities in his Adminiſtration. There were thoſe who failed not to put in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, the Deſigns and Inſtructions of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Richlieu;</hi> he had his Agents up and down the Kingdom, who inſinuated Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and Heart-burnings into the Gentry and People of the Land. The King was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented every where as a Tyrant, and all his Actions were miſconſtrued.</p>

                     <hi>Signior Roſſetti,</hi> the <hi>Pope's Nuntio</hi> at the <hi>Engliſh Court,</hi> beſide his Inſtructions from the <hi>Roman Pontiff,</hi> held a ſtrict Intelligence with the <hi>Cardinal.</hi> His Buſineſs at this <hi>Court,</hi> was <hi>publickly</hi> to the <hi>Queen</hi> (who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed an Obedience to the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>) but <hi>privately</hi> he was order'd to Negotiate an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation between the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Churches. <hi>Cardinal Richlieu</hi> thought to ſtrike two Marks with one Blow, that is, to embroil the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and procure himſelf the greater Eſteem with the <hi>Roman

                  <p>The <hi>Scots,</hi> about this Time, made another Incurſion into <hi>England.</hi> A <hi>Parliament</hi> was called, but no Good done. The <hi>King</hi>'s Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, made them grow High in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and Carriage, and all things tended to a General Defection.</p>
                  <p>A while after, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> revolted, and maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacred above a Hundred Thouſand <hi>Engliſh.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> is accuſed for being Privy to it; Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults are raiſed, who, in threatning manner, ſeem'd to beſiege the <hi>Royal Palaces,</hi> calling out for Juſtice; not much unlike the Sedition of our <hi>Janizaries;</hi> when they are diſpleaſed with the Conduct of our Glorious <hi>Sultans,</hi> or his <hi>Prime Miniſters</hi> of <hi>State.</hi>

                  <p>Permit me, Venerable Sage, to converſe with thee a little, after the Manner of a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil; with thee, I ſay, who art a Fountain of Sapience; For, beſides thy perfect Knowledge of the <hi>Divine Law,</hi> thou art acompliſhed with all <hi>Humane Literature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a Man in theſe Parts, of a large Soul and elevated Speculations, who ſtiffly
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:102956:63"/>maintains, That the Earth moves, and the Sun ſtands ſtill. He is not the firſt that broach'd this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> it has had ſeveral Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Patrons;</hi> but, he has highly Improved the <hi>Theory.</hi> His Reaſons for it, have almoſt the Force of <hi>Mathematical Demonſtrations;</hi> and, nothing ſeems to oppoſe him, but the Authority of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the <hi>Hebrew Scriptures.</hi> The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> will not approve of any <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,</hi> which interferes with that which they call the <hi>Bible;</hi> and yet their Practice, gives a perpetual Lye to the Contents of that Book. Surely, there is no Envy in the <hi>Deity;</hi> and, He that is <hi>Omniſcient,</hi> will not puniſh Men for improving their Knowledge. The Study of <hi>Nature,</hi> is full of Innocent Delights; and, he that gave to Man an Appetite of Science, has not forbid him to gratifie it with its proper Objects. Nor can I ſee how this <hi>New Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,</hi> contradicts any more than the bare Letter of their <hi>Bible,</hi> (for, I have read it in ſeveral Languages;) And, the <hi>Jews,</hi> who are the <hi>Guardians</hi> of the <hi>Original Hebrew,</hi> allow a <hi>Cabaliſtical</hi> Interpretation far different from the <hi>Literal:</hi> So does the <hi>Arabian</hi> Prince and <hi>Philoſopher, Avicen,</hi> Interpret thoſe Verſicles in our <hi>Holy Alcoran,</hi> (which treat of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe</hi>) in a Sence far more refined than the Letter ſeems to import. In reading ſuch Myſterious Books, it is neceſſary to practiſe a Learned <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> to ſublimate the groſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Sence of the Words, and to extract the Spirit and Soul of the Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>That the Sun is the Center of this our Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netary
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102956:63"/>World, and that the Earth with the Reſt of the Planets move round about it, is a <hi>Theſis</hi> which keeps exact Touch with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reaſon, and ſeems naturally to ſquare with our Intellectual Faculties. It ſets all the Wheels of this Great and Wonderful <hi>Machine,</hi> in a regular and proportionate Circulation. It gives the trueſt Account, of the Retrograde Motions of the Planets. <hi>Ptolomey</hi>'s Syſtem of the World, ſeems to Romance upon the Sun, Moon, and Stars, in aſſigning them hourly ſuch prodigious Journeys through the Heavens, as are inconſiſtent with the Laws of Motion. And <hi>Tycho Brahe</hi> was but a Botch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in patching up the Orbs with his <hi>Eccen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricks, Epicycles,</hi> &amp;c. The former, keeps the Fixed Stars in an endleſs and unconceivable Hurry; the latter involves the Planets in a Heavenly Perplexity. Both come far ſhort of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> that Excellent <hi>Aſtronomer,</hi> who by placing the Sun in the Center of the World, has ſolv'd all the Appearances of <hi>Nature</hi> with the moſt exact Analogy to Truth. Nor is the Argument, taken from our Sence, of any force, ſince it invalidates the Motion of the Sun as well as that of the Earth: nay it is more incongruous, that the Sun ſhould move ſo many Hundred Thouſand Miles every Hour, and we not perceive him to ſtir a Hairs-breadth at a time. But I will not intrench farther on thy Patience, nor run the Riſque of a <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigo,</hi> by purſuing the ſwift Orbicular Motions of <hi>Nature.</hi> It matters not much, whether the Sun ſtands ſtill, or the Earth, provided
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102956:64"/>we run the Race that is appointed us, ſo as to gain the Prize. Yet I will ask thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on another Point, which Men of high Reaches have ſtarted.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome Learned Men who ſay, the Moon and reſt of the Planets are habitable as our Globe is. For my part, to ſpeak freely, I could wiſh it were true, it is a ſociable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. It has made me melancholy ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, when I have caſt my Eyes upwards, to think all thoſe Ample Tracts in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be void of Inhabitants, and yet ſcarce a Turf of our Dunghil Earth to be found without its Domeſticks. It is demonſtrable to the Eye, that the Moon is an Opake Body like this Globe whereon we tread, having no other Light, but what it borrows from the Sun. Where is the Hereſie then, in ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that it is created for a like uſe? I hope, the <hi>Sacred Empire</hi> of the <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> will not ſtain it ſelf with ſuch a Barbarous Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as was committed on <hi>Vigilius</hi> a certain <hi>Chriſtian Biſhop,</hi> who was burnt by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> for Aſſerting the <hi>Antipodes;</hi> a Truth which all Nations are now ſenſible of, ſince the Improvement of Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and Traffick. And yet <hi>Galilaeus</hi> had like to have undergone the ſame Sentence at <hi>Rome,</hi> within theſe Ten Years, for maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Earth's Motion, and that the Sun is the fixed <hi>Center</hi> of the World; Nothing but his Recantation being ſufficient to have ſav'd him. Such Severities choak the Growth of Learning, and ſtop the Progreſs, which would
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102956:64"/>otherwiſe be made in Arts and Sciences.</p>
                  <p>Happy are the Students that live under thy Auſpicious <hi>Patronage,</hi> in that fruitful <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> of <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> where the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> are taught free from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Licentiouſneſs of the Ancient <hi>Pagans,</hi> or the Superſtitious Rigours of Modern <hi>Infidels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I pray the <hi>Sovereign Intelligence,</hi> not to withdraw from thee his Divine Influence, nor reſtrain the Floud of Light that has been let looſe on thy Soul; but that thou mayſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow like <hi>Nilus,</hi> and enlighten not only <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick,</hi> but the whole World with ſome New Diſcovery.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>Weſtern Philſophers,</hi> eſpecially thoſe who follow the Sentiments of <hi>Monſieur des Cartes,</hi> maintain, That the Souls of all living Creatures (except Men) are Material and Mortal; that a Beaſt is but a Machine, like a Watch or Clock, not actuated or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by any <hi>Spirit</hi> diſtinct from the <hi>Body,</hi> but moved to the Performance of all Natural
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:102956:65"/>Actions by a mere Corporeal Mechaniſm, 'ſet on Work by various Impulſes from External Objects.</p>
                  <p>In this they oppoſe <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and all the Sages of the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> And thou knoweſt, that our <hi>Arabian</hi> Doctors are of a contrary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, who aſcribe Rea'ſon, Diſcourſe, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, to the Souls of Bea'ſts, as well as to thoſe of Men; having aſſigned particular A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments for <hi>Elborach,</hi> the Beaſt: which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried our <hi>Holy Prophet</hi> from <hi>Mecca</hi> to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem;</hi> for the <hi>Ram</hi> which <hi>Abraham</hi> ſacrificed inſtead of his Son <hi>Iſaac;</hi> for the <hi>Cow</hi> of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> the <hi>Piſmire</hi> of <hi>Solomon,</hi> the <hi>Whale</hi> which ſaved <hi>Jonas,</hi> the <hi>Raven</hi> which fed <hi>Elijah,</hi> the <hi>Aſs</hi> which rebuked <hi>Balaam;</hi> and, in General, for all the <hi>Camels</hi> which have the Honour to carry the <hi>Sacred Alcoran</hi> to <hi>Mecca.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will ſuſpend my Belief of their being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> till I ſhall have the Happineſs to ſee them there; but, I cannot however acquieſce to the Opinions of theſe <hi>Modern</hi> Philoſophers, who aſſert their Souls to be meer Matter. The Bodies both of Men and Beaſts, I own, perform all Motions by Mechanick Rules; but, that Mechaniſm is guided by a higher Principle than the fortui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Impulſe of External Agents, in Beaſts as well as Men.</p>
                  <p>All Animals ſeem to me to be endued with a Faculty, which if it may not be called Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet is ſomething Analogous to it, for which we want a Proper Name. And, of this Mind were <hi>Empedocles, Pythagoras, Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:102956:65"/>and <hi>Porphyry,</hi> with many other Ancient Sages. Though this Faculty is more eminently conſpicuous in ſome Kinds of Beaſts than in others.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but admire the Regular Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture of <hi>Bees,</hi> their Induſtry and Politick Oeconomy, vying with the moſt Excellent Form and Adminiſtration of Government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men. 'Tis with no leſs Pleaſure I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the <hi>Spider,</hi> when with exquiſite Art ſhe builds her little ſilken Palace, and lays her fine-wrought Trains to catch the unwary Fly. 'Tis equally Pleaſant and Diverting to obſerve the Conduct of the <hi>Piſmires,</hi> their prudent Forecaſt; how they trudge up and down all the Summer, to lay up a ſufficient Stock of Provinder for the barren Winter. There is no kind of Bird, four-footed Beaſt or Fiſh, which does not confute this <hi>Carteſian Hypotheſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is credibly reported by <hi>Porphyry,</hi> that in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> there is a Beaſt which they call a <hi>Hyaena,</hi> which approaching near the Villages will imitate a Man's Voice, and calling the Inhabitants by their Names, if they come out of their Houſes, 'twill ſeize on the firſt that comes to hand, and devour him. The <hi>Dog,</hi> the <hi>Ape,</hi> the <hi>Elephant,</hi> with many other four-footed Beaſts, afford us manifeſt <hi>Specimens</hi> of Reaſon, or ſomething very like it.</p>
                  <p>Who has not heard of the Love which <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins</hi> bear to Men? <hi>Pliny</hi> relates a pretty Story of a <hi>Dolphin</hi> that frequented the Lake <hi>Lucri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and being often fed from the Shore by a certain School-Boy, grew at length
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:102956:66"/>ſo familiar as to come at a call. We alſo read of another, who took the Muſician <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi> on his Back (when caſt into the Sea by cruel Sailers) and carried him ſafe to Shore.</p>
                  <p>Can all theſe Actions proceed from mere Matter? In my Opinion, 'tis as eaſie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, That Humane Nature it ſelf is but Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo and ſo Modified, and, that all the Buſtle Men keep in the World, is but the Effect of a better Compoſition of Body, the Reſult of a more perfect and refined Machine.</p>
                  <p>I eaſily agree, that we far excel the other Living Creatures in all the Operations of our Souls, and Exerciſes of our Reaſon: Yet, we have our defects as well as they; and, this I eſteem as one of the greateſt, to deny them any ſhare in <hi>Reaſon,</hi> who ſo far excel us in <hi>Sence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a culpable Pride and Envy in Men, thus to blaſt the Reputation of their <hi>Animal</hi> Kindred; from which Vices I know thou art free.</p>

                  <p>THY Commands I receive as Marks of thy Eſteem and good Will, which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire may be perpetual. Thou haſt an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Share in the Favour of our <hi>Auguſt Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;</hi> and, I ſhall ſtudy to Merit thy Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by all the dutiful Offices that can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from a <hi>Slave</hi> in my Station.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing ſo much conduces to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh a permanent Friendſhip, as a right Underſtanding. The Souls of Friends are firſt warp'd by Miſapprehenſions. I would not have thee think of me, as I do of my ſelf; that would prompt thee to Contempt: nor, as the <hi>French</hi> do, who take me for <hi>Titus</hi> of <hi>Moldavia;</hi> but, look upon me (whatever my Failings are) as a Man that values and practiſes the Incorrupt Fidelity of the Firſt Ages. I abhorr Treachery, and, for that Reaſon, am often forced to make an Officious Lye: Yet, I do not proſtitute my Conſcience, having the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s Diſpenſation. Whenever it ſhall be told thee, that <hi>Mahmut</hi> degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, ſuſpect the Slanderer; perhaps he would ſupplant me: I am not fond of my <hi>Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> but I dread to looſe the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Favour: Whoſoever deprives me of that, robs me of my <hi>Honour,</hi> which is dearer to me than my <hi>Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:102956:67"/>
                  <p>By what I have ſaid, thou wilt perceive, that I am not ignorant of the ill Offices which <hi>Ikingi Cap'-Oglani</hi> has done me. The Man aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, and is envious: Were I in his Poſt, I would not exchange the Honour and Felicity of Educating the <hi>Royal Pages</hi> of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> for an Employment attended with infinite Hazards, and no leſs Trouble, as is that of <hi>Mahmut.</hi> If he be expert in the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, there are thoſe that excel him; and Language is but the Shell of more ſubſtantial Accompliſhments. Every <hi>Linguiſt</hi> is not fit to be Employed in the <hi>Secrets</hi> of <hi>State;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are all <hi>Paedagogues Politicians.</hi> I am ſtartled at the Ambition of a Man, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has ſtudied at <hi>Athens,</hi> thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf worthy of the Confidences of the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Port,</hi> which arbitrates the Fate of all the Kingdoms in the World. If this be not his Aim, why does he daily traduce me? Why does he paint me to the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Divan,</hi> in black and odious Colours, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading them, it is my Natural Complexion? He is not content with the Calumnies he himſelf throws on me, but has corrupted <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman</hi> my Couſin, and hired him to miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent me to the <hi>Kaimacham:</hi> And, that he might be ſure to ſtrike home, he has drawn to his Party <hi>Shaſhim Iſtham,</hi> the <hi>Black Eunuch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſent <hi>Solyman</hi> a Letter laſt Year, full of Reproofs, not knowing who had ſet him at Work: I hope it had ſome good Effect on him, though late. 'Tis from him I received
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102956:67"/>this Intelligence. He ſeems to repent of his Malice, telling me, That this <hi>Ikingi Cap'-Oglani,</hi> had ſo Artificially poſſeſſed him with a Belief of my Perfidiouſneſs, that he thought he did good Service to <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> to rail at me; but, that the <hi>Kaima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cham</hi> had afterwards convinced him of my Innocence. This was the Subſtance of his Letter, and he concludes it with begging my Pardon.</p>
                  <p>I tell thee, Illuſtrious <hi>Baſſa,</hi> that though the Wounds which are given by the Tongue of a Slanderer, be deeper than thoſe which are given by the Sword; and, I could ſooner pardon him who ſought manfully to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way my Life, than he which baſely Murders my good Name; yet, I attribute my Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Fault, to Youthful Error, and a Loyal Miſtake; and I love him the better, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any one that he could imagine would prove Unfaithful, and a Traytor to <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>May the benign Heavens bleſs thee with their good Influences, and proſper thee in all Things.</p>

                  <p>THY Apology is rational and modeſt, and I am glad to be thus happily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd. Thou ſeeſt, the <hi>Kaimacham,</hi> with the other <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Port,</hi> have too good an Opinion of me to liſten to the Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations of deſigning Men; and, <hi>Ikingi Cap'-Oglani</hi> was out of his Byaſs, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fam'd the <hi>Loyal Mahmut;</hi> and, the <hi>Black Eunuch</hi> had better been watching the Ladies than wounding my Reputation with his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venom'd Tongue. I wiſh thee hereafter to avoid all Company, that profeſs a Kindneſs to thee, which thou maiſt but ſo much as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to be forc'd.</p>
                  <p>Thou askeſt my Counſel how to conduct thy ſelf toward thy Firſt Wife, of whom thou ſpeakeſt both well and ill. Thou believeſt her faithful and chaſt; thou knoweſt her to be induſtrious and careful of the Family; good-natur'd, flexible and obliging; but, thou ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeſt her of a violent and haughty Spirit, fiercely paſſionate, and of a provoking Tongue. She daily and hourly reflects upon thy Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages; will play the School-Miſtriſs with thee, pretending to correct, reprove, inſtruct, and guide thee in all thy Actions. In fine, thou
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:102956:68"/>complaineſt, that thou canſt not enjoy Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility with her.</p>
                  <p>I tell thee, Kinſman, thou ſhouldſt have applied thy ſelf to the <hi>Imaum's</hi> and <hi>Derviſes</hi> in this Caſe, or, at leaſt, to ſuch as have had Experience of a Married Life. Their Sentence would be more Authentick, than what thou canſt expect from me. But ſince thou haſt made choice of my Counſel, I will give thee the beſt I can.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt, in my Opinion, find it difficult to be happy with or without this Woman. She is given thee by <hi>Fate,</hi> to poiſe the Balance of thy Life; that neither too much Eaſe nor Pain, exceſs of Joy or Grief, ſhould turn the doubtful Scales of Sence, and make thee ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſwim in Flouds of Pleaſure uncontrouled, or ſink in Mire of baneful Grief and Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.</p>
                  <p>The chaſt Fidelity, which thou believeſt her endued with, cannot be valued at too high a Rate. It is a Vertue which renders Woman adorable. Likewiſe, her Diligence and Care, her Reſpect and Devoir, her eaſie Temper and good Nature, are Qualities which cannot but charm thee. Shouldſt thou deal unkindly by her, thy generous Soul would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret it the next Moment. Nay, ſhouldſt thou take the Common Courſe, and diſmiſs her with a <hi>Bill</hi> of <hi>Divorce,</hi> according to the Law, thou wouldſt repent the Deed within twice Four and Twenty Hours.</p>
                  <p>And yet, I muſt confeſs, 'tis hard to be confined to a fierce Woman's Tongue, to bear
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102956:69"/>Reproaches and Contumelies, Contempts and Defiances, Lectures and other Female Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. Who, that's a Man, can brook ſuch Slavery? Who, that has but a Spark of Fire within this Hulk of Clay, can ſtoop to ſuch ignoble and unmanly Softneſs? I cannot coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel thee to ſuch an abject Tameneſs of Spirit. Man is Lord of all his Fellow-Creatures. The fierceſt Beaſts ſubmit to his Imperial Sway; Woman alone, ambitious Woman, diſputes the Government with him. But, 'tis his Right, and he diſowns both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> who reſigns it to that aſpiring Sex. Yet, uſe thy Power moderately; keep the Golden Mean. Be not ſurly and rough as a Bear, nor yet ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate and without Gall as a Dove. But, if thou findeſt it impoſſible to keep her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Bounds of due Subjection, put her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and ſo preſerve thy Peace. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of thy other Wives, will ſoon efface her lov'd <hi>Idea,</hi> and ſweeten thy Loſs with a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand new Pleaſures. But, if they ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her Steps, inheriting her Spirit, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting thee with killing Words, divorce them all. I would counſel thee to take ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively Five Hundred Wives, rather than make thy Life miſerable, by too much Love and Indulgence, to one that knows not how to uſe thy favours.</p>
                  <p>But, before thou beginneſt to put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution this Advice, try all the fair and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Methods thy Wit can ſuggeſt, to win her to a Senſe of her Fault, and a Change of her Temper. For, be aſſured, that it will be of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:102956:69"/>leſs Pain to thee, to have an Eye pluck'd out of thy Head, than to tear from thy Heart, the firſt Object of thy Love.</p>
                  <p>In this, and all things elſe, have an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Regard to thy Conſcience, and to the <hi>Obſerving Angel,</hi> who writes down all thy Actions in a Book. Do nothing which may merit the Chaſtiſement of the <hi>Two Black An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> who ſhall viſit thee in thy Grave. He who deals unjuſtly and cruelly by Women on Earth, ſhall be deprived of the Felicities which our <hi>Holy Prophet</hi> has promis'd us, in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of that beautiful Sex in <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Keep the Law, and thou wilt have thy fill of Love, both here and in the Bliſsful Bowers of <hi>Eden.</hi>

                     <hi>To the</hi> Kaimacham.</head>
                  <p>THE Surrender of <hi>Perpignan</hi> to the <hi>French,</hi> ſtartles the World; A Place inexpug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable by Arms, and not to be reduced but by Famine. Some that pretend to penetrate into Foreign Secrets, lay the blame on the <hi>Duke d' Olivarez.</hi> They ſay, that when the King of <hi>Spain</hi> firſt heard that <hi>Lewis</hi> laid Siege to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102956:70"/>this Important Place, he would have gone in Perſon to its Relief, but that the <hi>Duke</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred his Deſign, fearing leſt his own Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages ſhould take Wind, when the King was got on the Frontiers: This, they ſay, put a ſtop to the Levies that were making in <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and damp'd the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of thoſe who were actually in Arms.</p>
                  <p>Whether this was the Effect or no, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the <hi>Duke d' Olivarez</hi> had ſufficient Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be Conſcious, knowing, that the <hi>Grandees</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> watched for an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to diſlodge him from the King's Breaſt. But, it is ſtrange, that he ſhould at ſuch a Time, neglect any thing that might confirm him in his Maſter's Favour, as the ſaving of <hi>Perpignan</hi> muſt needs adone; all the Succeſſes and Miſcarriages of the <hi>State,</hi> in Peace or War, being attributed to the <hi>Favourite Miniſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where-ever the Fault lies, I have heard no Man yet condemn the <hi>Governor</hi> of the Town. 'Tis ſaid, he has given all the Marks of a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Souldier, a Prudent Commander, and a Faithful Subject. Theſe Vertues are to be honoured, even in an Enemy.</p>
                  <p>They report, That the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King put a kind of Superſtitious Confidence in the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs d' Avilla,</hi> becauſe one of the ſame <hi>Family</hi> and <hi>Title,</hi> had formerly Defended the Place to Extremity, till the Siege was raiſed. Aſſuredly, Vertue is not inherent in Names, nor Victory entailed to all of the ſame Blood. Both the one and the other, are owing, in a great Meaſure, to Providence and Chance.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:102956:70"/>The <hi>Romans</hi> did not gain more in the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi> War, under the Conduct of <hi>Scipio</hi> the <hi>African,</hi> than they loſt afterwards, when another of that Name, was <hi>General</hi> of their Army.</p>
                  <p>'Tis ſaid, the <hi>Duke d' Olivarez</hi> is ſeized with a Phrenzy upon the Loſs of this Town, or, at leaſt, counterfeits one. I do not aſſert this as a Truth, Illuſtrious <hi>Kaimacham,</hi> but to ſhew thee, how People are addicted to cenſure, not only the Miſcarriages of Great Men, but the very Regrets which attend their Misfortunes; as if it were a Crime in them, to mourn for the Calamities which they could not prevent.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, <hi>Cardinal Richlieu</hi> has weathered a Tempeſt raiſed againſt him, by the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleance</hi> and his Party. As if the Fate of theſe Two <hi>Miniſters,</hi> ran Counter; and, <hi>One</hi> muſt Riſe by the <hi>Other</hi>'s Fall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Olivarez</hi> had laid a Train for <hi>Cardinal Richlieu</hi>'s Deſtruction, but fell into it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He had corrupted one of the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s Creatures, who aſſociated himſelf with the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> and the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans.</hi> Beſides private Grudges, they all ſuſpected the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> as deſigning, upon the King's Death, to take the <hi>Regency</hi> into his own Hands. They acquaint <hi>Olivarez</hi> with their Grievances, and enter into a private League with him. He, in hopes to rend the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>France</hi> into fatal Diviſions, as well as to ruine the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> agrees to furniſh the Conſpirators with Twelve Thouſand <hi>Foot,</hi>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:102956:71"/>and Three Thouſand <hi>Horſe; Sedan</hi> was to be the Rendezvous of this Army.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Cardinal Richlieu,</hi> whom no Secret could eſcape, ſoon diſcovered the Plot, and acquaints the King with it; who, forthwith cauſed the Conſpirators to be ſeized, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, and Two of their Heads to be cut off; the reſt were pardoned on Conditions of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, and perpetual Baniſhment from the King's Preſence.</p>
                  <p>This happened much about the Time that <hi>Perpignan</hi> ſurrendred, which was, on the Ninth of the <hi>Moon Ribiul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A little before, the Conſpirators had ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcur'd the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s Credit at the <hi>Court,</hi> that the King denied him a Viſit, when requeſted, in his Sickneſs; upon which, the <hi>Cardinal</hi> withdrew himſelf. But, the King was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glad to follow him; having no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge in the midſt of his Preſſures, but him who was Maſter of all the Hearts, both of his Subjects and Allies. At that time, the <hi>Count de Guiſche,</hi> was defeated in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and, the <hi>Pariſians</hi> were apprehenſive, that <hi>Dom Franciſco de Melo</hi> would bring his Forces into the Bowels of <hi>France.</hi> None was able to extricate the King out of ſo many Troubles, but the <hi>Chief Miniſter.</hi> Thus, by a Fortunate Concurrence of Events, the <hi>Cardinal</hi> is reſtored to his Maſter's Favour; ſees his Foreign Enemies humbled, <hi>Perpignan</hi> taken, and his Domeſtick Foes cut off and baffled.</p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:102956:71"/>
                  <p>I pray <hi>God,</hi> whoſe Eye is over the <hi>Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, to preſerve thee from all the Machinations of thine Enemies, and make thee to ſhine bright in the Favour of the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi>

                  <p>THY Letter, with <hi>Carcoa</hi>'s Journal, is come ſafe to my Hands, and the Ring which he bequeath'd me. That Legacy, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates his Affection, and that I have not ill deſerved of him: For, the Actions of Dying Men, are void of Diſguiſe.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Memoirs</hi> will be of great Service to me, containing a more accurate Hiſtory of the <hi>German Court,</hi> from the Year 1600, to the Time of his Death, than I have yet ſeen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. I am not unacquainted with Relations of this Kind. The <hi>Europeans</hi> make their <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories</hi> ſpeak, what their Affection or Fear ſuggeſts, rather than the Truth. The Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Printing, has debauched the Integrity of moſt Writers; they ſtudy rather to pleaſe, than inform the Age. For this Reaſon, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102956:72"/>the greateſt Part of <hi>Modern</hi> Hiſtory; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veting onely, the <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> of ſuch as <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coa.</hi> He ſpeaks Impartially, having no other. Byaſs, than the Service which he owed to the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſpeak this for thy Encouragement and Direction, who ſucceedeſt that honeſt Old Man in his Poſt. When thou committeſt any of thy Obſervations to Paper, let them be of Things Remarkable and True.</p>
                  <p>The Banker to whom thou didſt addreſs the Bill for my Payment, made a demurr at firſt, but <hi>Eliachim</hi> clear'd up his Doubts. I deſire thee to order Matters ſo hereafter, that I may not be taken for a Cheat: That may prove of ill Conſequence to us all. I would not have any ſiniſter Accident ſtarted, which might make the <hi>French</hi> ſuſpect me. One Misfortune ſeldom goes without Attendance. The leaſt blemiſh upon a Man's Credit, ſtreight infects the Air. He whoſe Reputation is bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, is ſuſpected and ſhun'd like a walking Peſtilence.</p>

                  <p>THOU that art a Light to the Blind, the Pole-Star to them that are bewilder'd in an Ocean of Uncertainties; the Sanctuary of the Mind, hatter'd with a Tempeſt of vain Opinions; tell me why it is Blaſphemy to ſay, That <hi>God</hi> has already taken Fleſh, (as the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Believe) ſince our <hi>Holy Prophet</hi> himſelf avouches, That <hi>God</hi> ſhall aſſume a <hi>Body</hi> at the <hi>Reſurrection?</hi> I approach thy <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Palace,</hi> with burning Coals on my <hi>Head,</hi> with fervent and enflamed Zeal in my Heart; caſt a gracious Eye on thy Suppliant. Reſolve my Doubts; diſſipate the Miſts which cloud my anxious Soul, and reſtore me to a right Mind.</p>
                  <p>If a <hi>Body</hi> be compatible with the <hi>Divine Eſſence,</hi> it ſeems not to me a Blaſphemy in the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to aſſert the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> whom Our <hi>Holy Prophet</hi> calls alſo, the <hi>Breath of God.</hi> If this <hi>Breath</hi> or <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> be not of the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the <hi>Divinity,</hi> why is that Part of the <hi>Chriſtian Goſpel</hi> had in ſuch Reverence, by the <hi>Faithful Muſſulmans,</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>In the Beginning was the</hi> WORD, <hi>and the WORD was with</hi> God, <hi>and</hi> God <hi>was the</hi> WORD? If the <hi>WORD</hi> be of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:102956:73"/>the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> then it will neceſſarily follow, that <hi>God</hi> has taken a Humane Body, ſince our <hi>Holy Prophet</hi> calls him the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> whom the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> adore for <hi>God Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</hi> Bear with my Weakneſs and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and, if I err, correct me in thy Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And yet, let not theſe ſeem ſo much my Scruples, as the Arguments of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> whom I would gladly convince of their <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie;</hi> but, it muſt be with ſolid Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Let not my Lord be angry, if I ask one Queſtion more: Our <hi>Holy Doctors</hi> teach, That the dark Spots in the Moon were made, when the <hi>Angel Gabriel</hi> flew by, and bruſh'd the Moon with one of his Wings: I ask how great that Wing was, that could make an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion ſo great, as to be conſpicuous to us at this prodigious Diſtance? Or, is <hi>Gabriel</hi> to be numbred among thoſe Lofty <hi>Angels,</hi> who can ſtride from one Star to another? If he be, Was there not Room enough in the vaſt endleſs Skies, or, did he loſe his Way through untrack'd Orbs, or, did he chance to wink in his Career, that he ſhould thus unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately daſh the paler Lamp of Heaven? If he be one of thoſe foremention'd mighty, tall, and wide-ſtretch'd <hi>Angels;</hi> How came he ſo to be contracted, when he viſited <hi>Mary</hi> the <hi>Mother</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> in her Cloſet, and preſented her with a <hi>Roſe</hi> that grew in <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſwer me this, O Sovereign <hi>Oracle</hi> of Truth, ſince my Ears are frequently invaded with ſuch Objections and Blaſphemous Jeſts, by theſe <hi>Infidels.</hi> How can I hear our <hi>Holy
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:102956:73"/>Law</hi> abuſed, and not burn in Spirit? Tell me, I pray, how I ſhall ſilence theſe bold Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, theſe Mockers of the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Glory?</hi> Think not this a frivolous Queſtion, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to Religion; for, theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are Sagacious and Subtle; if they can find one Flaw in the <hi>Holy Alcoran,</hi> they'll cry down all the reſt as falſe and an Impoſture; at the very thought of which <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> my Heart trembles.</p>
                  <p>Not long ago, a famous <hi>Aſtronomer</hi> ſhew'd me in a <hi>Teleſcope</hi> the Globe of the Moon, through which it ſeem'd to me an Opake Body, like the Earth we tread on; and, he affirmed it to be ſo, giving me <hi>Mathematical</hi> Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations for it; telling me alſo, it was Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table as our Globe; and, that the Difference of the Brighter and more Obſcure Parts of the Moon, conſiſted only in this, That the one was Firm Land, the other Fluid Water; and, if I may believe my Eyes, when aided by that <hi>Optick</hi> Inſtrument, it is no otherwiſe than as he ſaid.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Aſtronomer,</hi> is renowned throughout the <hi>Weſtern</hi> World, being eſteemed the Beſt <hi>Philoſopher</hi> that ever wrote of <hi>Natural</hi> Things. His Name is <hi>Renatus des Cartes.</hi> I have been often converſant with him, and took unſpeakable Delight in his refined Notions of the World. He is as dextrous at unravelling the Contexture of the very Elements, as tho' he had ſtood by the <hi>Eternal Artiſt</hi> when he extracted them from the Rude <hi>Chaos.</hi> The minuteſt Particle of Matter, which is to the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102956:74"/>Eye of other Men inviſible, appears to him in its proper Figure; he talks as familiarly of globous, ſquare, and triangular Atomes, as though he had a Pair of Compaſſes to take their true Dimenſions by. Were not this admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Genius</hi> ſtain'd with great Impiety, in that he mocks the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Glory,</hi> the <hi>Holy Alcoran, true Guide</hi> to <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> I ſhould believe he was inſpired from above.</p>
                  <p>One Day diſcourſing about the Body of the Moon, he broke out into this Blaſphemous Jeſt, <hi>The</hi> Arabian <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>might as well have made his Followers believe what we prate to Children, That there is a Man in the Moon with a Bundle of Faggots on his Back, as to tell them that Fable, of the</hi> Angel Gabriel<hi>'s bruſhing this</hi> Planet <hi>with his Wing.</hi> I was not able to hear any more; but took my Leave.</p>
                  <p>Furniſh me therefore, O Sacred Repoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of all true Science, with ſuch convincing Arguments, as may put to Silence theſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious <hi>Infidels.</hi>

                     <hi>To</hi> Cara Haly, <hi>the</hi> Phyſician <hi>at</hi> Conſtantinople.</head>
                  <p>SUffer me to converſe with thee after the Manner of Friends, with Freedom and Familiarity. I have often diſcovered to thee the Diſtempers of my Body, now I will reveal thoſe more dangerous ones of my Mind. And
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:102956:75"/>I know not, whether they are Diſtempers, or Cures of ſuch. I have writ to the <hi>Mufti</hi> on the ſame Subject, in Part, but with Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Reſerve. With thee I will deal frankly, and pour into thy Boſom the Secrets of my Heart.</p>
                  <p>I am diſſatisfied in many Things pertaining to Religion. 'Tis true, I cannot think or ſpeak of our <hi>Holy Prophet,</hi> but with infinite Attach and Veneration; yet, I owe ſomething to my Reaſon. I will believe, the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of <hi>God</hi> was true and perfect; but is it a Crime to think, his <hi>Succeſſors</hi> were but Men, ſubject to Frailty and Errour? Their Diviſions, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the Death of our <hi>Great Lawgiver,</hi> juſtifie this Reflection, ſince the fatal Schiſm continues to this Day. Either the <hi>Perſians,</hi> or We, muſt be in the wrong. Grant which thou wilt, it follows, that the Truth was no ſooner ſown in the World, but it ſprung up in Mortal <hi>Hereſies;</hi> and, I find no other Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that we are in the Right, but the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of our <hi>Doctors,</hi> the Followers of <hi>Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and <hi>Ebubecher;</hi> who, for ought I know, are no more exempted from Errour, than the Diſciples of <hi>Haly.</hi> Both Sides believe the <hi>Holy Prophet,</hi> yet both at Infinite Diſtance in their <hi>Interpretations</hi> of his <hi>Law.</hi> Each Party boaſts they have the True Sence of the <hi>Divine Oractes,</hi> and curſes the oppoſite for <hi>Hereticks. Truth</hi> cannot be repugnant to it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>From this Original Schiſm, well near a Hundred ſeveral <hi>Sects</hi> have ſprung, each main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining different Interpretations of the <hi>Law.</hi>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:102956:76"/>While <hi>Truth</hi> can be but One, where ſhall a Man be ſure to find it amongſt ſo many Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to it?</p>
                  <p>Think not, that I am going to turn <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> becauſe of this Liberty I take to ſearch for <hi>Truth.</hi> For, the Caſe is the ſame, or worſe among them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeſus</hi> (whom our <hi>Holy Prophet</hi> calls <hi>the Breath and Word of</hi> God, <hi>the Reformer of the</hi> Law <hi>of</hi> Moſes, <hi>knowing the Secrets of Hearts, and working Miraeles</hi>) preach'd to the <hi>Jews Repentance,</hi> good Works, the Reſurrection of the Dead, the Day of <hi>Judgment,</hi> the <hi>Joys</hi> of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and the <hi>Torments</hi> of <hi>Hell.</hi> He choſe Twelve <hi>Diſciples,</hi> to diſperſe his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine over the World. But, they likewiſe had Diſſentions among themſelves, after that <hi>God</hi> had taken the <hi>Meſſias</hi> up to <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> Each <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> leaving different Traditions behind him in the Countries where he taught. Hence ſprung the Difference between the <hi>Churches</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt,</hi> and thoſe in <hi>Aethiopia.</hi> One following <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> Another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>John,</hi> the Third defending the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Matthew.</hi> And, from theſe greater <hi>Schiſms,</hi> have ſprung innumerable ſmaller <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Hereſies:</hi> Each <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Party,</hi> Excommunicating, Damning and Curſing all the Reſt; yet all believe they ſhall be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>Thus is the World at Odds about <hi>Religion,</hi> perſecuting, biting and devouring one another, becauſe they cannot all think alike. A ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Argument of Religion, and a ſpecial En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to gain Proſelytes.</p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:102956:76"/>
                  <p>Theſe Conſiderations have made me a <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> in Controverted Points of <hi>Faith</hi> and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Opinion. Onely in this I am fixed, That I believe in <hi>One Eternal God,</hi> and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence his <hi>Holy Meſſengers</hi> and <hi>Prophets.</hi> But, if an <hi>Angel</hi> from Heaven ſhould tell me mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous and incredible Stories, of Things repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the common Senſe and Reaſon of all Mankind, I would deſire him to excuſe me if I ſuſpended my Belief.</p>
                  <p>I admire the <hi>Golden Age,</hi> when the Infant World had not yet learn'd Bigotry; when <hi>Humane</hi> Reaſon was not corrupted with <hi>Divine</hi> Fables; and, Natural Conſcience, was the <hi>Oracle</hi> to which all reſorted for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of their Doubts; before Superſtition had begun to dreſs the <hi>Deity</hi> in frightful, uncouth Shapes: Then harmleſs Innocence could ſhew her naked Face, which now is fain to go diſguiſed. No Man was put to Death for Words or Thoughts of Things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his Reach. No crafty <hi>Numa</hi> then had fobb'd upon the Credulous People his feign'd <hi>Aegeria;</hi> Nor Golden-tongu'd <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> could impoſe the forged Whiſpers of his Eagle on the ſilly <hi>Crotonians</hi> for Sacred <hi>Oracles.</hi> No Wonder-working <hi>Magician,</hi> had led the Rabble by the Noſe with his Infernal Juggles; but, pure and undebauched Reaſon taught Men to lead Immortal Lives on Earth.</p>
                  <p>Tell me, O Learned <hi>Haly,</hi> canſt thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, That the Divine Architect had no other Way to make Man, than by laying him a Thouſand Years broiling in the Sun? Or, that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:102956:77"/>there is an Apple-Tree growing very near the Throne of God? Or, that the <hi>Angels</hi> can ſtride ſome Hundred Thouſands of Miles at once? Can we not go to <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> unleſs we ſwallow theſe ſtrange Notions? Is it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to believe in <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Mahomet</hi> his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> except we will receive all for Truth, which the <hi>Doctors</hi> tell us? I Faſt and Pray at the appointed Times, and ſometimes oftner; I give Alms; I love all the Creatures of <hi>God,</hi> that remain in his Love; I am not guilty of Theft, Murder nor Adultery; I never forſwore my ſelf, nor bore Falſe Witneſs. Yet, when I am recollected, I think my ſelf the worſt of all Men; I think of every Peccadillo I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, with inexpreſſible Regret. If all this is not ſufficient to acquit me a true and good <hi>Muſſulman,</hi> no Man, I hope, will blame me, if I joyn with an eminent Man in theſe <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern</hi> Parts, and wiſh my Soul among the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers.</hi>

                  <p>THOU maiſt remember a Letter I ſent thee concerning the Death of <hi>Mary de Medicis, Queen-Mother</hi> and <hi>Dowager</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> wherein I alſo ſpoke, of the ſudden Sickneſs of the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> with the Reports, Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and Prophecies divulged on that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. What Spirit ſoever inſpired thoſe <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> 'tis certain, the Event juſtifies their
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:102956:78"/>Predictions. For, the <hi>Cardinal</hi> died this very Day, being the Fourth of the laſt <hi>Moon</hi> in the Year, at his Palace in this City, being not full Fifty eight Years of Age.</p>
                  <p>I am not very Credulous of Apparitions, Ghoſt, and ſuch like Themes of vulgar Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition: yet, 'tis evident, the <hi>Cardinal</hi> neither lived to ſee the Common <hi>New-Years Day,</hi> nor the Fifty-eight Year of his Life, as, they ſay, the <hi>Queen's Ghoſt</hi> foretold him.</p>
                  <p>Some that have been Curious in examining his <hi>Pedigree,</hi> tell me, that his <hi>Progenitors</hi> were allied to one of the Kings of <hi>France.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, 'tis certain, that he was deſcended of an Ancient and Honourable Family, of above Five Hundred Years Standing and Eminence in that Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>He had his Education in the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> where he attained the <hi>Degree</hi> of a <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> of the <hi>Sorbon;</hi> a <hi>Dignity</hi> much eſteemed in <hi>France,</hi> and moſt Parts of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> except in <hi>Rome;</hi> which <hi>Court</hi> is Jealous of the <hi>Sorboniſts,</hi> becauſe they have ſometimes De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in Prejudice of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Authority, and the Grandeur of the <hi>Roman Court.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this he was made a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> then <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> next <hi>Secretary</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> in which Station he acquitted himſelf ſo happily that the King procured him the Dignity of a <hi>Cardinal.</hi> There are none of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Divan</hi> but know, that a <hi>Cardinal</hi> is one of the <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>During theſe ſeveral Stairs of Preferment, he had ſignalized his great Abilities, in Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:102956:78"/>Affairs of greateſt Moment. Yet, in nothing did the Dexterity of his Wit appear more, than in reconciling the Miſunderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings between the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Whereby, he gained much upon both their Affections; ſo that in a little Time, he was made the <hi>Principal Miniſter</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> and <hi>Chief Director</hi> of the <hi>Government;</hi> having a Guard of Souldiers appointed to attend his Perſon.</p>
                  <p>Then he was made <hi>Superintendent</hi> of the <hi>Marine</hi> Affairs; after this, <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> of the Armies. So that, he ſeemed to have mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoliz'd all Command both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> by <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>Land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was Impoſſible for him to eſcape the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Eyes of the Grandees; nay, the <hi>Queen-Mother</hi> her ſelf, who firſt raiſed him, began now to grow Jealous of his great Power: But eſpecially, the <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Blood</hi> were highly offended at him. The <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Soiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> ſtomach'd the Indignity the <hi>Cardinal</hi> had offer'd him, in propoſing the Marriage of his Daughter. The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans</hi> ſuſpected his Deſigns upon the <hi>Regency.</hi> Yet, all their Conſpiracies againſt him proved ineffectual. For neither by Publick Arms, nor Private Machinations, could they ever prevail againſt the fixed Deſtiny of this Great <hi>Miniſter;</hi> who, though he had been often attempted to be Poiſon'd, Piſtol'd and Stabb'd, yet died quietly in his Bed, having a little before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Viſit from the King.</p>

                  <p>I will not preſume to make Corollaries or Gloſſes on theſe Things, as though I were able to Inſtruct thee, whoſe Wiſdom and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience renders thee a fit <hi>Oracle,</hi> for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Princes to reſort to in Time of Need.

                  <p>I Have ſent to the <hi>Kaimacham,</hi> an Account of the Death of <hi>Cardinal Richlieu,</hi> with ſome Paſſages relating thereto, wherewith I thought it not proper to Interrupt thy Diviner Thoughts.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Great Miniſter,</hi> died the Fourth of this Inſtant <hi>Moon,</hi> being the laſt of the Year, in his <hi>Palace</hi> at <hi>Paris.</hi> His Body is Interred in the <hi>Chappel</hi> of the <hi>Colledge</hi> of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> where he finiſh'd his Studies, and attained the <hi>Degree</hi> of <hi>Doctor</hi> in <hi>Theology.</hi> He
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:102956:79"/>has left behind him a prodigious Eſtate, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to a Million of Crowns Yearly; which he has bequeathed in Legacies to his Kindred, Friends and Creatures. And, as a particular Demonſtration of his Gratitude to the King, he has made him Heir of his <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal-Palace,</hi> in this City, with all the Plate and Furniture in it. And, at the laſt Viſit the King made him (which was a little before his Death) he preſented him with a Stone worth a Hundred Thouſand Crowns of Gold. Upon which, 'tis diſcourſed, that the King will ſettle a Yearly Revenue on a certain Number of the <hi>Sorboniſts,</hi> to celebrate <hi>Maſs</hi> daily for the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s Soul, during the Space of One Year, and once a Year afterwards on the Day that he died. For, theſe <hi>Infidels</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach thus near the <hi>True</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndefiled Faith,</hi> in that they have Hopes of <hi>Immortality,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the <hi>Dead,</hi> and, that the Prayers, Alms, and Good Works of the Living, do atone for the Sins of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted; as our Holy <hi>Doctors</hi> teach, and, as is the Practice of the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> throughout the World.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Cardinal,</hi> was richly endowed by <hi>Nature,</hi> having a firm Intellect, vigorous Spirit, quick Apprehenſion, ſolid Judgment, faithful Memory, and a moſt prevailing Way of Diſcourſe. A Man highly ſerviceable to his King and Country; and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving better of the <hi>French,</hi> than thoſe Scandalous Reports and Libels which were every where induſtriouſly ſpread abroad, to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:102956:80"/>leſſen his Fame. Yet, there wanted not thoſe who ſtrewed Flowers on his Grave, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed his Aſhes with <hi>Encomiums</hi> and Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyricks. In this he ſhared the common Fate of the <hi>Great,</hi> that he was Malign'd and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied Living, but honoured with the Tears of his very Enemies when Dead.</p>
                  <p>There is one Fault to be found in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, without appearing too Cenſorious, That he being a Man conſecrated to the Service of the <hi>Altar,</hi> ſhould ſo often take the <hi>Field,</hi> and diveſting himſelf of the Peaceful Robes of <hi>Religion,</hi> ſhould clothe himſelf in <hi>Steel,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting more in the Smell of <hi>Gunpowder,</hi> than that of <hi>Incenſe;</hi> and preferring the Noiſe of <hi>War,</hi> to the <hi>Hymns</hi> and <hi>Antiphons</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> Not, that Religion is incompatible with Valour; and, to fight for ones Country, is not as Lawful and as Pious, as to pray for its Proſperity. Our <hi>Holy Law,</hi> the Celeſtial Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of Truth to the World, exhorts us to Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. And all <hi>True Believers</hi> are aſſured of the Joys of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> of unfading Crowns, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Felicities, if they loſe their Lives in Defence of the <hi>Sacred Empire,</hi> and the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Glory:</hi> Our <hi>Immortal Lawgiver,</hi> giving us his own Example, when he laid the Foundation of the Greateſt and moſt Illuſtrious <hi>Empire</hi> in the World, in the Wounds of his Enemies, cementing the Work with the Blood of Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of <hi>Infidels.</hi> Nor has the Superſtructure been carried on by any other Methods, than thoſe of perpetual War, with the Nations who will not ſubmit to our <hi>Victorious Sultan,</hi>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:102956:80"/>the <hi>Invincible Lord of the Earth.</hi> But, the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of <hi>God</hi> never required the <hi>Imaum's</hi> or <hi>Derviſes</hi> to take the Field; leaving <hi>Arms</hi> only to <hi>Secular</hi> Men, and the <hi>Alcoran</hi> to the <hi>Religious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I forget that I am ſpeaking to him, whoſe Repoſe and Tranquility is the ſpecial Care of Heaven, who is not to be diſturbed by <hi>Emperors.</hi> Therefore, in profound Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, I ſalute thy <hi>Holineſs</hi> with a dutiful O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beiſance, and ſo withdraw my Pen.</p>

In this, thou art obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to her for thy Knowledge; thy Mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uneaſie in its diminutive Habitation, is for that Reaſon ſeldom at Home. Thy Soul is a perfect Night-Walker; when other Men
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:102956:81"/>are abed and aſleep, thou art taking thy Rounds among the Stars.

But, I would have thee beware, leſt they revenge themſelves on thee ſome time or other, as they did upon one of thy <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> by ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up a certain King to take away his Life. He was a bold Fellow, and pretended great Familiarity with the Stars: One Day he came to the King, and told him, he had exactly Calculated his Nativity; and, by his Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from thence, according to the Rules of Art, had diſcovered, That he ſhould not live out that Year. The King replied, <hi>I will prove, that my Skill is greater than thine; for, I know the very Hour of thy Death, which is now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely, and which all thy Knowledge in</hi> Aſtrology <hi>could never foreſee, nor be able to prevent.</hi> So, he commanded his Head to be immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cut off. I would not have thy <hi>Star-ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,</hi> ſo ſuddenly ſpoil'd; though, they ſay, thou haſt ventured to talk ſomewhat too largely.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Judicial Aſtrology</hi> ſeems, in a great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, obliged to <hi>Superſtition,</hi> for the Credit it has gained among Men; and, the <hi>Latin Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb</hi> ſays, <hi>A Wiſe Man ſhall over-rule the Stars.</hi> For my part, I would rather counſel thee to follow thy old Recreation, of teaching

                  <p>If thou couldſt by ſome lucky Contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſell thy <hi>Pigeons</hi> at ſuch a rate to <hi>Sultan Ibrahim,</hi> thy Time would be better ſpent, than in playing the <hi>Mercury,</hi> and bringing News from the Stars.

Would they have me coin News? Would they have me amuze them with Relations of Things which never had any Exiſtence? I
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:102956:82"/>have not failed hitherto to communicate to the <hi>Port,</hi> all the Intelligences I have received: But they ought to conſider, that the <hi>Winter</hi> affords little of Action.

                  <p>Thou ſeeſt, Moſt Serene <hi>Baſſa,</hi> the Tide of News is ſo low, that <hi>Mahmut</hi> is forced to ſtoop and receive it, puddled as it is by the Mouths of the Vulgar. If I acquaint thee with what thou kneweſt before, let not the

                  <p>There has been a long Difference, between the Princes of the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Savoy;</hi> which is at length compoſed, by the Marriage of Prince <hi>Maurice, Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> with his Niece, the Daughter of the <hi>Dutcheſs Regent.</hi> This is that which has warm'd the Courage of the <hi>French</hi> Army, at this Frozen Time of the

For, upon this Match, the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Brother, <hi>Prince Thomas,</hi> joined his Forces to the <hi>French,</hi> and took ſeveral Strong Caſtles and Towns from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whom before this <hi>Prince</hi> had aſſiſted: And now laſt of all, to wind up the Year, they have made themſelves Maſters of this <hi>Tortona,</hi> a Place environed with Rocks and Mountains.</p>
                  <p>By which thou maiſt perceive, that there is no Difficulty ſo great, which may not be overcome with Courage and Perſeverance.</p>

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:102956:84"/>a Compleat Stateſman; having accompliſh'd ſeveral Negotiations with great Succeſs and Applauſe.</p>
                  <p>Now the old Officers begin to be caſhier'd, to make room for the Creatures of this New <hi>Miniſter,</hi> the King abſolutely reſigning the Conduct of the Publick to him.

                  <p>T'other Day he had like to have been choak'd by a Piece of Beef, one Part of which hung faſt in his Teeth, and the other juſt reach'd the Paſſage to the Lungs; and, as it were barring up the door of that Paſſage, hindred his Reſpiration ſo long, that his Noſe ſuddenly ſtarted out a-bleeding; his Face grew black, and he was ready to drop down dead, had not one of his Attendants forcibly thruſt his Fingers into his Mouth, and faſtning on the Morſel, pull'd it out of his Throat.</p>
                  <p>He that is <hi>Lord</hi> of Life and Death, preſerve thee from all Perils, and make thee happy in the Service of our <hi>Great Maſter;</hi> who will

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> ſpeak of his Father, with much Reſpect, and Compaſſion of his Misfortunes; they ſay, he was deſcended from a Noble Captain, which the Renowned <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loign</hi> left in thoſe Parts, when he was enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the Wars of the <hi>Holy Land;</hi> and, that though <hi>Facardine</hi> wore a <hi>Turkiſh Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,</hi> yet he had <hi>French</hi> Bloud in his Veins. They tax <hi>Amurath</hi> with the Violation of his Oath, in cauſing him to be ſtrangled, when he had ſolemnly ſworn to the contrary. And ſome of them are ſo bold as to ſay, That if his Son <hi>Ali</hi> had not been kill'd, he would have ſhook the <hi>Throne,</hi> whoſe Foundation is deep
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:102956:86"/>as the Center of the Earth, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be moved without the Diſſolution of the Globe.</p>

He will lay claim to <hi>Gazir, D' Acre,</hi> and <hi>Saphet,</hi> thoſe being torn from his Father in that laſt Rebellion.

Then we are as in a Dream, and full of Anxiety; we grope about for Truth, and yet ſtumble upon Errors, as in the Depth of Night. So fared it with me, when theſe <hi>Infidels</hi> aſſaulted me with Queſtions and Cavils concerning our <hi>Holy Law.</hi> I heard them with Horrour and Pain, but knew not how to put them to Silence. I fled to thee for Succour, who art inſtructed in all Knowledge, true Heir of the <hi>Prophetick</hi> Light. But, a Ray from Heaven has prevented thy Anſwer; and, I will communicate to thee my Thoughts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God</hi> is moſt High, and <hi>Incomprehenſible;</hi> we cannot overtake him in his Ways. The Works of his Hands are perfect and full of Wiſdom. Why do the <hi>Infidels</hi> blaſpheme the <hi>Eternal? Gabriel,</hi> the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> bright and glorious, flew through the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens;</hi> and to avoid a burning Comet which then flamed in the Sky, he took his Courſe too near the <hi>Orb</hi> of the <hi>Moon;</hi> and, with the end of one of his Wings, he bruſh'd the Planet, leaving a Mark of the Stroak as a Memorial to the <hi>Angels</hi> for the Future; even as a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark is plac'd, to give warning of Rocks and Sands.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Infidels</hi> deride, and ask, <hi>How big was</hi> Gabriel<hi>'s Wing?</hi> Who can meaſure the Works of the <hi>Omnipotent?</hi> Let theſe <hi>Infidels</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber but the Atomes that cleave to the Soles
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:102956:88"/>of their Feet, when they walk in ſandy Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces! Or, let them weigh the Air, that is ſhut up in a Bottle! If they cannot perform theſe Things which are near them, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their reach, why do they mock at the Greatneſs of <hi>Angels,</hi> which dwell in the Immenſe <hi>Heavens?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They take their Meaſures of <hi>Celeſtial</hi> Things from the narrow ſearch of their Senſes, which yet fail them in common <hi>Terreſtrial</hi> Objects. If we believe our Sences, they would perſwade us, that the Moon is no bigger than a Royal Charger, and the Stars have no larger Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, than a Lamp or Torch: Whereas, we are aſſured by Reaſon and <hi>Aſtronomical</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, that the Moon is little leſs than the Globe of the Earth; and, that ſome of the Stars are near a Hundred Times bigger. If theſe Ornaments of the Sky, which look at this Diſtance like glittering ſparks of Fire, are really of ſo prodigious a Bulk; why may we not believe, that <hi>Angels</hi> who dwell higher than the higheſt Stars, are much greater, and more Magnificent Creatures than they? Nay, what Incongruity is it to believe, what our <hi>Holy Doctors</hi> teach, That the <hi>Angels</hi> can ſtride from one Star to another?</p>
                  <p>And now I am plunged thus far in the Depths of <hi>Nature,</hi> ſuffer me to wade yet deeper, nay, to ſwim in the Abyſs of ſpeculation. I will tell thee my Thoughts; The Works of <hi>God</hi> are <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmeaſurable,</hi> and there is no Bound or Limit to the Extent of the World; 'tis high as Thought can ſoar, endleſs as Imagination
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:102956:88"/>can travel. Who can tell, where the Walls of <hi>Paradiſe</hi> are? Or has any one gone the Circuit of the <hi>Seventh Heaven?</hi> Magnificent is the Fabrick of <hi>God,</hi> and the Apartments thereof are full of Majeſty. The <hi>Potentates</hi> above, are Glorious and Mighty; and, the Manſions of <hi>Angels,</hi> ſurpaſs in Grandeur this Viſible World. How great then is the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of thoſe <hi>Angels?</hi> Let not <hi>Infidels</hi> deride nor think it a <hi>Fable;</hi> for, the Diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Feet of an <hi>Angel,</hi> is many hundred Thouſand Miles. They turn the <hi>Celeſtial</hi> Orbs about (if what the Learned <hi>Chriſtians</hi> teach, out of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and other Old <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> be true, when they aſſign to each <hi>Sphere</hi> its par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Angel</hi> or <hi>Moving Intelligence.</hi>) How can this be done, unleſs the <hi>Angels</hi> were Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Mightier than the <hi>Orbs</hi> they move? Without all Doubt, the Leſſer is moved of the Greater, and the Weaker by the Stronger. Theſe are Arguments clear and intelligible, and ſuch as the <hi>Infidels</hi> cannot anſwer. Thus ſhall I be able to aſſert the Truth, againſt the impious; and to vindicate the glorious Works of <hi>God</hi> (the Strong and Potent <hi>Angels,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling in Majeſty and Grandeur,) from the Blaſphemies of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If they ask, How the <hi>Angel Gabriel</hi> (ſince he is of ſo prodigious a Stature) could be circumſcribed in the Cloſet of <hi>Mary</hi> the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of <hi>Jeſus?</hi> I ask them, How the Body of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which, they ſay, is in the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the <hi>Maſs</hi> (of which thou art not Ignorant) can be circumſcribed within the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:102956:89"/>narrow Compaſs of a <hi>Wafer?</hi> Or, How it can be there, and in <hi>Heaven</hi> at the ſame time, which they believe; nay, and in Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Wafers, in ſo many different Places of the World at once?</p>
                  <p>To this ſo preſſing an Argument they have no other Anſwer, but, That the Power of <hi>God</hi> is <hi>Infinite</hi> and his Works <hi>Incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> Very well! if he be <hi>Omnipotent</hi> in one Thing, is his Power <hi>reſtrained</hi> in another? If the <hi>Preſence</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> in ſeveral Places at the ſame time, be <hi>Incomprehenſible;</hi> ſo is the Appearance of the Mighty <hi>Angel Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel,</hi> in the <hi>Oratory</hi> of the <hi>Virgin Mary, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible</hi> alſo.</p>
                  <p>The Nature of <hi>Angels,</hi> is unknown to us <hi>Mortals,</hi> and the Manner of their Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Sufficient it is, to believe the <hi>Divine Oracles,</hi> and not to pry into the <hi>Secrets</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus ſhall I confute the <hi>Infidels,</hi> when they cavil againſt the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> thus ſhall I ſeal up the polluted Lips, and put to ſilence the Blaſphemous Tongues of the Enemies of <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Prophet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, they ſay, the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of <hi>God</hi> has promiſed a Senſual <hi>Paradiſe</hi> to the <hi>True Believers,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Glory</hi> mentions the Gardens of <hi>Eden,</hi> Gardens wherein flow many Rivers, Rivers of Wine, Milk and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, with Trees of all delectable Fruits; and, that the Righteous ſhall be cloathed in Veſts of Purple and Crimſon, repoſing on ſtately Beds, and ſhall enjoy the Company of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:102956:89"/>Women, and ſhall be repleniſhed with Eternal Felicity.</p>
                  <p>Doubtleſs, they are blinded with Malice and hood-wink'd by the Spirit of Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: Elſe, why do they thus cavil at the manifeſt Light of Truth, the Doctrine of Faith, the undefiled Article of Glory? They profeſs to believe, the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> as well as we: Will they not then believe, that <hi>God</hi> hath provided Pleaſures ſuitable to the <hi>Body</hi> after its <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> I mean, the <hi>Bodies</hi> of the <hi>Juſt?</hi> They tell their Diſciples and Proſelytes doleful Stories of the Pains of the Damned in Hell, as Burning in Fire and Brimſtone. Nay, the <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> it ſelf, ſpeaks of a Lake of Sulphur and Fire. Are not theſe Torments to be inflicted on the Body, which they own are prepared for the Wicked? And will they deny proportionate Pleaſures to the <hi>Bodies</hi> of the <hi>Juſt</hi> in <hi>Paradiſe?</hi> What uſe will there be of our <hi>Bodies</hi> after the <hi>Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> if not to enjoy <hi>Bodily</hi> Pleaſures, or feel the Rigour of <hi>Infinite</hi> Pains? Doubtleſs, the <hi>Juſt</hi> ſhall be repleniſhed with all the Joys; and, the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt,</hi> with all the Dolours of which their Senſes are capable. And, this they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves believe; yet, theſe captious <hi>Infidels,</hi> pick Quarrels with our <hi>Holy Lawgiver,</hi> and ſay, That the <hi>Paradiſe</hi> which he promiſes, is fit for none but Fools or Beaſts.</p>
                  <p>I have read in <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Devotion,</hi> which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> uſe, That the <hi>Bleſſed</hi> in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> ſhall be ſatiated with all Manner of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. The Eye ſhall always behold moſt
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:102956:90"/>Beautiful Objects; the Taſte ſhall be gratified with incredible Sweets; the Smell ſhall be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with all Manner of rich Odours and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes, far ſurpaſſing the <hi>Aromaticks</hi> of <hi>Arabia;</hi> the Ear ſhall hear ſuch wonderful Muſick, as one onely Strain thereof, were ſufficient to lull all the Hearts of this Sublunary World aſleep: In fine, there ſhall be none of their Sences and Faculties, which ſhall not be tranſported and raviſhed with infinite Delights. What is all this, but Senſual Pleaſure? Can there be any plainer Deſcription of Bodily Enjoyments than this? Why do they then maliciouſly traduce the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and reſiſt the <hi>Truth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But they will ſay, that the Pleaſures which they ſhall enjoy after the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> will be refined and ſpiritual as their <hi>Bodies</hi> ſhall be: Whereas, they ſay, our <hi>Prophet</hi> intimates groſs, carnal Enjoyments; as, the Company of Beautiful Women, and ſuch amorous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights.</p>
                  <p>Certainly, they are wilfully blind, and ſhut their Eyes againſt the Light; or elſe, they would eaſily ſee through the Veil of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories</hi> and <hi>Metaphors,</hi> which our <hi>Divine Prophet</hi> uſes in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> to adapt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Heavenly Things, to the dull Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of Men; even, as all the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> have done before him. In the <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel, Paradiſe</hi> is deſcribed under the Figure of a moſt <hi>Magnificent City,</hi> built all of Gold and Precious Stones, with a River flowing by it, and Trees whoſe Fruit never
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:102956:90"/>withers, nor their Leaves fade. Will the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> take this in the Literal Senſe, or do they own it to be an <hi>Allegory?</hi> If the latter, then why do they Blaſpheme the <hi>Sacred Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> of our <hi>Holy Lawgiver,</hi> becauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the Felicities of <hi>Paradiſe</hi> under Senſible Figures and Types, ſuch as are moſt apt to work on the Affections of Men?</p>
                  <p>It is not to be thought, that our Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Beautiful Women in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> ſhall be attended with the Leaſt of thoſe Impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which ſtain it in this Life. Our Pleaſures ſhall be agreeable to the Place whither we go, pure and immaculate. As we ſhall there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Perfection of Beauty, without the ſmalleſt Allay of Deformity; ſo, in our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, we ſhall be tranſported with the Heighth of Extaſie, without the leaſt Mixture of Pollution.</p>
                  <p>Nor ſhall theſe Bodily Delights ſuperſede or hinder our more Spiritual Enjoyments; but, both Body and Soul ſhall be raviſhed with Eternal Felicities.</p>
                  <p>Tell me, thou who art the <hi>Key</hi> of the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> whether I am now ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arm'd with Reaſons, to withſtand the Cavils and Objections which the <hi>Infidels</hi> make againſt our <hi>Holy Law!</hi> I have laid at thy Feet my Sentiments, ſubmitting all to thy unerring Wiſdom; vouchſafe to confirm what I have well ſaid, and to correct my Errors. And, in the Midſt of thy <hi>Divine</hi> Ejaculations, glance a Thought on the humbleſt of thy <hi>Slaves,</hi> praying for the <hi>Exil'd Mahmut,</hi> that he may
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:102956:91"/>perſevere in the <hi>true Faith;</hi> and, at the End of his Life, may taſte the Joys of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> which he zealouſly aſſerts againſt the <hi>Infidels.</hi>

                  <p>WHEN I informed thee of the Siege of <hi>Perpignan,</hi> I had not heard of the Extraordinary Honours which were done to the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Morgues</hi> during that Siege. This <hi>Prince,</hi> was a Subject of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and had in Poſſeſſion the Town of <hi>Monaco.</hi> Yet, for ſome diſguſts which he had received from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he ſome Years ago had thoughts of throwing himſelf upon the Protection of the King of <hi>France;</hi> but, Difficulties ariſing, it took not effect at that Time. However, in the Year 1641. by the Dexterity of the <hi>Governour</hi> of <hi>Provence,</hi> he was ſo far wrought upon, that a <hi>French</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon was by his Connivence put into <hi>Monaco,</hi> and he totally threw off his Obedience to the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> and though great Offers were made him by the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet he rejected all; and, to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to King <hi>Philip,</hi> That his Soul was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together

                  </p>
                  <p>After which, Four Galleys of <hi>Naples</hi> crui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on the Sea before <hi>Ville-Franche,</hi> one of them by the Order of the Captain ſailed to <hi>Monaco,</hi> not having heard of the Revolt of this Place.

                  <p>IT ſeems as if the late Revolution in <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> had imbitter'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, and ſwell'd the Spleen of that Nation with inſupportable Rancour. The Loſs, which they cannot hope fairly to recover by Arms, they ſeek to Revenge by diſhonourable Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſine and Treachery.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Marquis de Los-Velez,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh Ambaſſador</hi> at the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> could not brook to ſee there an <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> from the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> whom he eſteemed at beſt but a Subject or a Traytor to <hi>Philip</hi> his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi> He tryed all means to prevent and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:102956:92"/>his Audience with the <hi>Pope,</hi> and openly demanded, that he might be ſent back into <hi>Portugal</hi> with Diſgrace. But, the <hi>Sieur de Fontenay, Ambaſſador</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and countenanc'd the <hi>Portugueze Miniſter,</hi> which precipitated the <hi>Marquis de Los-Velez,</hi> to one of the blackeſt Attempts that has ever ſtain'd the Records of Time.</p>
                  <p>Thou art not to learn, that the <hi>Perſons</hi> of <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> are by the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nations</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed <hi>Sacred;</hi> their <hi>Houſes, Sanctuaries;</hi> and, whatſoever Injury is offered them, is at leaſt accounted a <hi>Civil Sacrilege.</hi> Yet, the <hi>Spaniſh Ambaſſador</hi> finding the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mego</hi> (ſo was the <hi>Portugueze</hi> called) protected and favoured by the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, reſolves to leap over the Fences which ſecure the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities and Safety of his own Function, and to violate the Law without which he himſelf could not ſleep free from Danger in his Bed. For, being informed that the <hi>Portugueze Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador</hi> was gone to viſit the <hi>Sieur de Fonte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay,</hi> he goes out of his Houſe with a Train of about Twenty Men, and covering his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign with a pretence of going to the Houſe of an Eminent <hi>Cardinal,</hi> he takes the ſame Way, as the <hi>Portugueze Biſhop</hi> was to return to his Houſe. But, the <hi>French Ambaſſador</hi> having Notice, that one of the <hi>Marquis</hi>'s Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue was obſerv'd to dog the <hi>Biſhop</hi> to his <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,</hi> and return immediately to his Maſter, ſet ſome Spies upon the <hi>Marquis de Los-Velez,</hi> who brought him Word, that the <hi>Marquis</hi> had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred all his Retinue to arm themſelves and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:102956:93"/>follow him. This gave a ſufficient Alarm and Suſpicion to <hi>De Fontenay,</hi> ſo that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Thirty of his Servants to arm like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and follow him in ſeparate Parties, at a Diſtance from one another; being reſolved to protect the <hi>Portugueze,</hi> who was an <hi>Allie</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and to prevent the Deſign of his Enemies. No ſooner had the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mego</hi> taken his Coach, but Notice was given to the <hi>Spaniſh Miniſter,</hi> who immediately advances toward him, big with the Murder he intended to commit. But, the <hi>French</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and falling briskly on the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> kill'd Seven of them in a Moment, and broke through the Reſt, even to the very Coach of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis,</hi> with a Reſolution to make him taſte the Death he deſigned for the poor <hi>Biſhop.</hi> But, he had the Fortune to eſcape into the <hi>Palace</hi> of a <hi>Spaniſh Cardinal,</hi> and ſo ſaved himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniſh Ambaſſador</hi> after this, being netled at his ill Succeſs, and the Favour which the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Lamego</hi> found in that <hi>Court,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to remove to <hi>Naples;</hi> but, the <hi>Pope</hi> ſet a Guard on him to prevent it, till ſuch time as he had given Hoſtages for the Indemnity of his <hi>Nuntio's</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Naples.</hi>

But, the <hi>Pope</hi> knew how to return the <hi>Viceroy</hi>'s Compliment, without hazarding his own Eſtate; telling him, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Forces were more than ſufficient to conquer the <hi>Duke,</hi> had he any other Deſigns than thoſe of Peace.</p>
                  <p>By this Paſſage of the <hi>Spaniſh Ambaſſador,</hi> thou mayſt comprehend the Licentiouſneſs of the <hi>Infidels,</hi> who dare trample upon <hi>Human</hi> and <hi>Sacred</hi> Laws; and, that in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, where the <hi>Supreme Mufti</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> keeps his Seat.

                  <p>I Could not let this Poſt go without a Letter, though I have nothing material to write. However, 'tis a Teſtimony of my Duty, to let thee know, that <hi>Mahmut</hi> is not Idle, that he ſuffers not an Hour, a Moment, to eſcape, wherein he ſtudies not to do ſome acceptable Service to the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the <hi>Diſpatches</hi> which I receive from the <hi>Port,</hi> ſeem like black Clouds, gathering on the Margin of the <hi>Horizon,</hi> the ſure Harbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of an approaching Storm. One accuſes me of neglecting the Service of the <hi>Maſter</hi> of the <hi>World;</hi> Another tells me, I am too Expenſive; a Third ſays, the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Divan</hi> will take other Methods. They mince their Expreſſions; no Man will deal plainly with me. They mix Threatnings with Complements, as if I were a Child, and needed the Diſcipline of a Rattle and a Rod. Would they have me reverſe the <hi>Decrees</hi> of <hi>Deſtiny?</hi> Turn <hi>Winter</hi> into <hi>Summer,</hi> and change the whole Order of <hi>Nature?</hi> Or, is it expected, that I ſhould renew the Exploit of <hi>Cadmus,</hi> and cauſe <hi>Earth-born</hi> Armies to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, on purpoſe to furniſh Matter of News to the <hi>Port?</hi> I appeal to thee, Supreme <hi>Vizir,</hi> at whoſe Nod the <hi>Divan</hi> is Aſſembled or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, whether I deſerve the Cenſures that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:102956:94"/>are paſs'd upon me? No Man can accuſe me of betraying my Truſt, or of holding any Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the Enemies of the <hi>Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire.</hi> What is then my Crime? Am I to be condemned, for employing the Money which is allotted me for Subſiſtence, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my <hi>Miniſtry</hi> more Succeſsful? Will they call it, an embezilling the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Money; when, rather than hoard it up for my own private Profit and Conveniences, (as I might do conſiderable Sums, were I ſo baſely Frugal) I frankly part with it, to conſummate the Affair for which I am placed here? Or, is the <hi>Ottoman Treaſury</hi> grown low, that heretofore has ſupported the Indigent World, and by an Exceſs of Royal Munificence, has been thrown to the Fiſhes of the Sea? Is <hi>Mahmut</hi> alone to be eſteemed a Prodigal in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Expences, becauſe 'tis known that he was a <hi>Slave</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and tyed down to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurious Stint of a rigorous Patron? Suffer me this once, Sage <hi>Miniſter,</hi> to vindicate my ſelf, and to tell thee, That the Hardſhips and ſqualid Circumſtances of Captivity, would not be very ſubſervient to the Ends for which I am ſent hither; neither can a niggardly Penſion, qualifie me for the <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>Court</hi> in which I muſt be daily converſant, where all Things appear Gay and Polite. It has not been my Cuſtom to complain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Cauſe, neither do I love to grate my Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, with whining Remonſtrances. But, it is my humble Requeſt, That the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> of the <hi>Divan</hi> would conſider me, not as a
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:102956:95"/>Drudge to a Private Man in <hi>Palermo,</hi> but as the Indefatigable <hi>Slave</hi> of the Moſt Opulent and Liberal <hi>Monarch</hi> in the World.</p>
                  <p>In all theſe Things, I contract my ſelf into a moſt ſubmiſs Reſignation to thy Will, who art the <hi>Vicegerent</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Rock of <hi>Deſtiny;</hi> beſeeching thee, to protect me from the Malice of Whiſperers, who envy me becauſe I ſerve the <hi>Sovereign</hi> of <hi>Sovereigns, Lord</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and all that is between them.</p>
                  <p>May the Eternal Poſſeſſor of all Felicity, cull out of his Immenſe Treaſures, ſuch Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings as thou moſt ardently deſireſt in this Life; and, when he has led thee through all the Apartments of Human Bliſs on Earth, may he tranſlate thee to the Palaces of <hi>Eden,</hi> the Seats of an Immarceſcible Life, where new Sources of Joy are open'd without End.</p>

                     <hi>To</hi> Murat Baſſa.</head>
                  <p>THE Floods have been ſo great, and thoſe alſo congealed into Ice, that there has been no travelling by ſome Roads for theſe Two <hi>Moons;</hi> which is the Reaſon, we have been wanting in our uſual Advices from <hi>Germany, Piedmont,</hi> the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and other Parts.</p>
                  <p>Yet now, the Poſts bring a Glut of News to this City. <hi>Fribergh,</hi> a Town in the Parts of <hi>Saxony,</hi> is at this Time beſieged by <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenſon, General</hi> of the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Army. He Inveſted it the 11th. of the 1ſt. <hi>Moon.</hi> And, People are amazed to hear, that it has held out thus long, being a Place of no great Strength. Eſpecially, conſidering how ſoon <hi>Leipſick</hi> ſurrender'd to the ſame Forces; a Town well fortified, and ſtored with all Things neceſſary to ſuſtain a long Siege. By this thou mayſt obſerve, how much the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of War many Times depends on one ſucceſsful Battel.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Torſtenſon</hi> firſt lay down before <hi>Leip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,</hi> it was generally believed, he would find a ſtout Reſiſtance from the Inhabitants, and an Inflexible Reſolution in the Garriſon, not to yield that Important Place: And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they would not have been miſtaken, had not the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> (out of a Generous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:102956:96"/>to relieve it, and raiſe the Siege) hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Battel. The <hi>Arch-Duke</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> (whoſe Name is <hi>Leopold</hi>) and <hi>Picolomini,</hi> as ſoon as they received Advice that the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Army had paſſed the <hi>Elbe,</hi> and enter'd into <hi>Miſnia,</hi> took their directeſt Way to ſtop their Advance into thoſe Parts. But, it had been better they had kept their Quarters; for, in one Battel, they loſt all the Glory which they had before acquired by their Arms. <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenſon</hi> was already intrenched before <hi>Leip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,</hi> when his Scouts brought him Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that the <hi>Imperial</hi> Army was near at Hand. He immediately diſpoſes of his Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in a ſecure Place, draws out his Cannon, and having left a ſufficient Number of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to guard the Poſts of his Camp which were neareſt the City, he marches directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Enemy, and poſſeſſes himſelf of a Spot of Ground very agreeable to his Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; it was called, the <hi>Plain</hi> of <hi>Brittenfield.</hi> This Place he deſigned for the Stage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to perform the Part of a Prudent, and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant <hi>General.</hi> For, as ſoon as he came in Sight of the <hi>German Vanguard,</hi> he cauſed his Army to retreat faintly, as though he had no Intention to fight. The <hi>Germans</hi> purſue the Retreating <hi>Suedes,</hi> till they were got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to very narrow <hi>Streights</hi> between Two ſteep Mountains; not much unlike the <hi>Capi Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent</hi> in <hi>Bulgaria</hi> (where the <hi>Heyducks,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Advantage of the Heights, commit great Robberies on the <hi>Caravans</hi> that travel through thoſe <hi>Streights,</hi> rolling huge Stones,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:102956:96"/>or rather Rocks, down upon the Paſſengers.) Here the <hi>Suedes</hi> turned about, and falling behind their Cannon, which <hi>Torſtenſon</hi> had cauſed to be planted in theſe <hi>Streights,</hi> play'd furiouſly on the <hi>Germans,</hi> while the Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers which he had order'd on the Sides of the Mountains, gaul'd them from above, yet lay themſelves Inviſible, under the Covert of Thickets which grew on each Side of the <hi>Streight.</hi> It was the <hi>Left Wing</hi> of the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts</hi> which was thus engaged, and <hi>Pico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomini</hi> who commanded them, gave admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Proofs of an undaunted Courage, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing at the Head of his Surprized Soldiers, and heartning them with Words and Actions full of Bravery; but, his Labour was loſt, for Six Thouſand fled without drawing a Sword. The <hi>Suedes</hi> purſued them through the <hi>Streight,</hi> and re-entring the <hi>Plain,</hi> engaged with the <hi>Right Wing</hi> of the <hi>Germans.</hi> The Battel was fierce and Bloody. <hi>General Picolomini</hi> did Wonders, and many brave <hi>Germans</hi> ſignalized their Valour; but, it ſeems as if the Fate of <hi>Torſtenſon,</hi> is to ruine the <hi>Empire:</hi> For, while the Battel was yet equal on both Sides, and the Victory doubtful; while the Ground was dyed with a Mixture of <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Suediſh</hi> Blood, he falls into the Main Body of the <hi>Imperial</hi> Army with a freſh Reſerve, which ſo animated the <hi>Suedes</hi> and diſorder'd their Enemies, that at length the <hi>Germans</hi> not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble longer to ſuſtain the Shock, left their Cannon and retreated into a <hi>Foreſt.</hi> Now followed a Dreadful Slaughter; for, the <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:102956:97"/>Cavalry</hi> environ'd the chas'd <hi>Germans,</hi> whom <hi>Coningſmark</hi> had hunted out of the <hi>Foreſt,</hi> and charged them with ſuch Fury, that they were moſt of them cut in Pieces. The <hi>Germans</hi> loſt Four Thouſand Men on the Spot, and as many more in the Purſuit.</p>
                  <p>I have ſent thee in the incloſed Paper, a Liſt of all the Officers of Note which were ſlain in this Battel, which is eſteemed one of the moſt Bloody, that has been fought in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> between <hi>Chriſtians</hi> on both Sides theſe Two Hundred Years. Thou wilt there find above Three Hundred Commanders, from whom a Death not Inglorious has taken their <hi>Commiſſions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Germans</hi> alſo loſt Six and Forty Pieces of <hi>Cannon,</hi> Sixty Five <hi>Standards,</hi> all their <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition,</hi> a Hundred and Sixty <hi>Carts,</hi> and Six Hundred <hi>Wagons;</hi> with all the Treaſury of the <hi>Arch-Duke Leopold,</hi> and <hi>General Pico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomini.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Battel was fought, on the Firſt of the Eleventh <hi>Moon,</hi> as we reckon; but, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Account, on the Twenty Firſt of the Tenth <hi>Moon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this Signal Victory, <hi>General Torſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> ſhewed himſelf again before <hi>Leipſick,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the Walls, planted his Batteries; and, though the Beſieged at firſt made ſhew of a firm Reſolution to defend the Place, yet the Terror which the late Defeat of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Forces had ſtruck them with, ſoon alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their Counſels, and they ſurrender'd upon Honourable Conditions.</p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:102956:97"/>
                  <p>In the mean Time, <hi>General Picolomini</hi> and the <hi>Arch-duke</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> are retired into <hi>Bohemia.</hi> The <hi>German Court</hi> is full of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions; and, new Levies are every where making, to join the ſhatter'd Remnants of the Army. The Affairs of the King of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> are at an ill Paſs, and all things look with a Cloudy Aſpect on the <hi>Empire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the Side of <hi>Italy,</hi> we hear nothing of Moment, but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are taking ſuch Meaſures, as may beſt repair the Loſs of <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tona;</hi> and, to that End, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Milan</hi> is making all the Preparations which are cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary in ſuch Caſes.

                  <p>May theſe Quarrels of the <hi>Infidels</hi> continue, till the determinate Time ſhall come, that our <hi>Victorious Armies</hi> ſhall ſubdue them to the <hi>Muſſulman</hi> Empire.</p>

                  <p>WHEN I ſent thee Word of the Death of <hi>Cardinal Richlieu,</hi> I thought it the ſame thing, as if I had preſented thee with the Head of one of the moſt Dangerous Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the <hi>Ottoman Empire.</hi> That Head which while the Owner lived, was always plotting of Miſchief, had it not been diverted by nearer Intrigues, would not have fail'd to put ſome horrid Deſign in Execution againſt the <hi>Sublime Port,</hi> which of all the <hi>Thrones</hi> in the World, ſeems alone to o'er-top the <hi>Grandeur</hi> of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, this <hi>Court,</hi> ſeems to play the <hi>Hydra;</hi> for, no ſooner is the Head of one of her <hi>Prime Miniſters</hi> laid, but upſprings another in the Room of it, equal in Vigour and Subtilty. And we have ſtill as much Reaſon to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Counſels of <hi>Cardinal Mazarini,</hi> as before we had to ſuſpect thoſe of <hi>Richlieu.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Generality of the People at firſt, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for another Conduct in the King towards the Creatures of the <hi>Late Miniſter;</hi> ſince he himſelf, toward the latter End of his Life, ſeem'd to ſubſiſt in the <hi>Court,</hi> rather through the Neceſſity the King had of his Counſels, than any Motive of Affection.</p>
                  <p>However, the King has exactly complied with the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s dying Requeſts, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:102956:98"/>ſeveral of his Relations and Friends, with <hi>Places</hi> of conſiderable Truſt. And, 'tis to his laſt Recommendation, <hi>Cardinal Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini</hi> is obliged for the Authority he now poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes. In uſing of which, he diſcovers a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Policy, and a Modeſty which hath but few Examples.</p>
                  <p>The many Combinations and Attempts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Cardinal Richlieu,</hi> and the King's Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him during the Siege of <hi>Perpignan,</hi> ſufficiently inſtructed <hi>Mazarini,</hi> that it was impoſſible to poſſeſs ſo Eminent a Charge, without drawing on him the Envy and Hatred of the <hi>Grandees.</hi> He conſidered alſo, That he was a Stranger, whereas <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu</hi> was a Native of <hi>France.</hi> Therefore, he unites his Intereſt with that of Two Great Officers, who alſo courted the King's Favour; the one, is <hi>Superintendent</hi> of the <hi>Finances;</hi> the other, <hi>Secretary</hi> of <hi>State.</hi> Theſe being long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er acquainted with the nice Tranſactions of the <hi>Court,</hi> and the Intrigues of the Grandees, do him no ſmall Service with their Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and likewiſe abate the Popular Spight, or at leaſt, ſhare it with the <hi>Cardinal;</hi> ſince no Body will be ſo partial, as to lay the Blame of any Miſcarriage on Him alone, who ſeems to do nothing without the Direction of his Two Partners, (for ſo he calls them, as if theſe Three ſhared among them the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Defunct <hi>Cardinal.</hi>) This is a pure Trick of <hi>Mazarini;</hi> and he ſerves himſelf of them as we uſe a Ladder, deſigning by their Means to mount by ſafer Steps, and on their
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:102956:99"/>Shoulders, to lift himſelf unenvied to the Helm of the <hi>State.</hi> Not, but that he is actually Inveſted with the <hi>Primacy</hi> by the King; but, he is willing to divert the Storm which that will draw upon him from the <hi>Nobles,</hi> therefore he cunningly ſeems to decline it, pretending an earneſt Deſire to with-draw into <hi>Italy,</hi> and in the <hi>Interim</hi> has choſen theſe Two for his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues. Thus he graſps with one Hand, what with the other he ſeems to reject; and by his Magnificent Living, his Obſequious Court, and obliging Carriage to all, he demonſtrates, that if he ſhould paſs the <hi>Alps,</hi> his Heart would be left behind him in <hi>France,</hi> and that he only aims to be eſtabliſh'd in the <hi>Miniſtery,</hi> with Univerſal Applauſe.</p>
                  <p>It makes me ſmile ſometimes, to ſee what pains he takes to entangle himſelf in Infinite Hazards and Trouble, as if he were of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution like that of a <hi>Salamander,</hi> which cannot live out of a Fire.</p>
                  <p>The Great <hi>God</hi> encreaſe the Vertues and Graces of the <hi>Illuſtrious Kaimacham,</hi> and of all the <hi>Miniſters</hi> that ſtand by the Bright <hi>Throne</hi> of Juſtice, the Seat of the <hi>Ottoman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors.</hi>

Among Foreigners, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and the <hi>German Emperor,</hi> charge him with Breach of Articles in his Treaties. So does the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> And all of them complain, That he alone has involv'd all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> in War and Blood.</p>
                  <p>Every Thing has two Handles, and Men are apt to take all things by the Worſt, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:102956:100"/>in Caſes of this Nature. It is difficult for a <hi>Sovereign Monarch,</hi> to carry himſelf ſo even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Peace or War, as to eſcape Obloquy; eſpecially, if he be Victorious. Loſers muſt have leave to be peeviſh.</p>
                  <p>But I forget that I ſpeak to him, who can repeal the Sentences of Greateſt <hi>Monarchs;</hi> before whoſe unerring Tribunal, all Earthly <hi>Dignities</hi> ſtand mute. Therefore, avoiding all impertinent Gloſſes, I will only preſent thee with what is proper to be ſaid without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality in <hi>Lewis</hi> his Vindication, being Matter of Fact, and leave the Deciſion to thy <hi>Sacred</hi> Judgment.</p>
                  <p>Herein it will not be amiſs to call to Mind, how the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the whole <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> have invaded and diſturbed the Peace of <hi>Europe,</hi> from time to time, theſe many Years.</p>
                  <p>The Uſurpation of <hi>Navarre</hi> by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> began the fatal Jarr, when he depoſed <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Albert</hi> and <hi>Catharine</hi> his <hi>Queen,</hi> though he himſelf had no other Title to this Kingdom, than what the Swords of the <hi>Arragonians</hi> and <hi>Caſtilians</hi> gave him; being of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> and <hi>Lyſander</hi>'s Mind, who knew no other Limits to their Dominions, than what their Enemies ſtout Reſiſtance ſet them. Thus <hi>Navarre</hi> being adjacent to Old <hi>Caſtile, Biſcay</hi> and <hi>Galicia,</hi> it became a Prey to <hi>Spain.</hi> Add to this, his Breach of <hi>Royal</hi> Word to <hi>Catharine de Medicis,</hi> (<hi>Queen-Mother</hi> of <hi>France;</hi>) to <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> the next Heir of <hi>Portugal;</hi> the <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Parma,</hi> and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:102956:100"/>
                     <hi>Catharine, Dutcheſs</hi> of <hi>Braganza;</hi> that he would acquieſce to the <hi>Chamber</hi> of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> in the Caſe of Succeſſion to the Crown of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal;</hi> when, contrary to all Law and Juſtice, he Invaded that Kingdom unawares, making it a <hi>Tributary Province</hi> to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Crown!</p>
                  <p>It has been the uſual Methods of Politick and wiſe Princes, to check the Torrent of their Neighbours growing Greatneſs, to lopp the Luxuriant Branches of ill-gotten <hi>Empire;</hi> and, had <hi>Henry</hi> IV. of <hi>France</hi> prolong'd his Life, 'tis thought he would have reconquer'd <hi>Navarre,</hi> and planted the <hi>Flower-de-luces</hi> in <hi>Fontarabia,</hi> and <hi>Pampelone.</hi> Who can then with Juſtice, tax <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. for managing a War, which all the World expected of his Father?</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Methods in conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> Two mighty <hi>Empires</hi> in <hi>America;</hi> their barbarous Cruelty, their inhumane Butchery of above Twenty Millions of the Natives, when neither Dignity, nor Age, nor Sex, was ſpar'd, but all became a Sacrifice to their Inſatiable Avarice of Gold, was a ſufficient Argument to incenſe all the Princes in the World againſt them.</p>
                  <p>I have no Intereſt in <hi>France,</hi> any more than I ſhould have in <hi>Spain</hi> if I were there: I only plead for Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>'Twas time for <hi>France</hi> to be alarm'd and ſtand upon her Guard, when ſhe ſaw her Potent Neighbour planting freſh Alliances and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts, like Batteries, round about her; had the Danger only threatned from beyond the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renean</hi>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:102956:101"/>Mountains, ſhe might have waited their Deſigns. But, when ſhe ſaw ſo many <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>States</hi> united in cloſe Leagues, and wholly ſubject to <hi>Spain,</hi> 'twas time to beat the Drum and carry the War from Home, 'twas time to climb the <hi>Alps</hi> and take a ſurvey of <hi>Spaniſh Italy;</hi> for, the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> the <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Millain,</hi> the <hi>Iſland</hi> of <hi>Sicily,</hi> the <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Mantua, Parma,</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin,</hi> the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Maſſa</hi> and <hi>Piombino,</hi> with the <hi>Free States</hi> of <hi>Genoua</hi> and <hi>Luca,</hi> did then all march under the Banner of <hi>Spain.</hi> So that none but the <hi>Great Duke</hi> of <hi>Toſcany,</hi> with the <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> were left to withſtand his threatning Arms. Who will now blame King <hi>Lewis,</hi> for drawing into his <hi>Confederacy</hi> the <hi>Hollanders, Heſſians, Griſons,</hi> and the <hi>Suedes?</hi> How could he otherwiſe diſſolve that formidable Union aforeſaid?</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the Murders of <hi>Henry</hi> III. and <hi>Henry</hi> IV. the one Kill'd at St. <hi>Clou</hi> by <hi>James Clement,</hi> the other at <hi>Paris</hi> by <hi>Ravillac,</hi> were ſo apparently hatch'd, and committed by <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Counſel and Influence, that, had <hi>Lewis,</hi> the late King, no other Reaſons to ſtand upon his Guard, and obſerve the Motions of <hi>Spain,</hi> yet that were enough to Juſtify his war-like Preparations againſt that Crown. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Motives of a Juſt Revenge, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Jealouſies of <hi>State,</hi> muſt needs prompt him to do his utmoſt, in Prevention of <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Intrigues.</p>
                  <p>Nor ought his matching with the <hi>Infanta,</hi> to have given him any greater ſecurity; ſince,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:102956:101"/>under the faireſt Graſs, many times lurks the moſt Venemous Snake. What <hi>Spain</hi> could not do by open Force nor ſecret Conſpiracy, ſhe hoped might be accompliſh'd by this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Marriage. And, it was no ſmall ſtep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it, that the numerous Train of <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> which came into <hi>France</hi> with the <hi>Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> preſently skrewed themſelves into all Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and Places of truſt, both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>States;</hi> daily making Parties and Penſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for <hi>Spain,</hi> till at length all <hi>France</hi> grew weary of them? ſo that the King was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to ſend them Home again: Elſe it is more than probable, that in a little Time he might have ſeen this flouriſhing <hi>Kingdom,</hi> in a worſe Condition than ever had been known before. He has already ſeen the Bowels of <hi>France</hi> ript up by Inteſtine Broils, and weltring in its own Blood; he has ſeen the Princes and Nobles armed againſt him, debauching and alienating the Allegiance of the <hi>French Gentry, Clergy</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> and covering their pernicious Rebellion under the Mask of the <hi>Holy League.</hi> He has ſeen the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Rohan</hi> leading up and down an Army of Twelve Thouſand <hi>Foot,</hi> and Twelve Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Horſe,</hi> at the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Coſt; he himſelf with his Brother <hi>Soubize,</hi> being both Penſioners to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Fourteen, the other Eight Thouſand Crowns a Year. In fine, he has ſeen the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Forts</hi> of <hi>Picardy, Normandy,</hi> and other <hi>Provinces</hi> of <hi>France</hi> plundered, and pillaged by flying Armies of <hi>Spaniards</hi> and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:102956:102"/>
                     <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> even when he leaſt dream'd of any ſuch Misfortune, being at the ſame time involv'd in <hi>Civil Wars</hi> with his own <hi>Subjects.</hi> After all this, had he not Reaſon to prevent the like Miſchiefs and Incurſions for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by tranſporting the War into his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Countries, who had committed ſo many Hoſtilities and Ravages in his?

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Arguments that may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, in Vindication of the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Conduct toward <hi>Spain.</hi> And not much leſs is to be recriminated upon the <hi>Emperor</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> his ſeizing the <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Cleves</hi> and <hi>Juliers,</hi> with many <hi>Towns</hi> and <hi>Biſhopricks</hi> in the Counties of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> and <hi>La Marck;</hi> as alſo in the Frontiers of <hi>Suiſſerland</hi> and <hi>Lorrain.</hi> His Conqueſt of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> with the chiefeſt Cities, Forts, and Paſſes of the <hi>Griſons;</hi> his reducing the Lives and Liberties of that People to their laſt Gaſp and Period, was a ſufficient Motive to the <hi>French</hi> King, to put a ſpeedy.

                  <head>To the <hi>Reis Effendi,</hi> Principal Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of State.</head>
                  <p>THREE Days ago, <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. King of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Navarre,</hi> was arreſted by the <hi>King of Terrors,</hi> and forc'd to pay the <hi>Grand Debt,</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature;</hi> I will not ſay, before it was due, but ſooner than the accuſtomed Time of Payment, being not full Forty Three Years old.</p>
                  <p>Yet <hi>Heaven</hi> was ſo Indulgent, as not to ſuffer the <hi>Grim Meſſenger</hi> of <hi>Fate,</hi> to ſnatch him hence without a previous Summons: His Diſtemper being a lingring Conſumption, which gave him frequent Intimations of his fading Strength.</p>
                  <p>There are not wanting ſuch as whiſper, That he was hurried out of the World before his Time, by ſome unnatural Artifice. And, the Common Sort ſay, that <hi>Mazarini</hi>'s Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, looks of a more <hi>Sanguine Hue,</hi> than it did Four Days ago.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſon of this Jealouſie, I ſuppoſe, is grounded on the Familiarity that has been obſerved between the now <hi>Queen-Regent</hi> and the <hi>Cardinal;</hi> both alſo being Strangers to the <hi>French</hi> Blood, ſhe a <hi>Spaniard</hi> and he an <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian.</hi> I will not determine how far theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections are juſtifiable, becauſe I know it is
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:102956:103"/>impoſſible for Perſons in their Circumſtances, to avoid the Cenſure of buſie prying Minds, in ſuch a Juncture as this: Yet ſome, who move in a Sphere above the Vulgar, cannot forget by whoſe Inſtigations his <hi>Royal</hi> Father, <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> was ſent out of the World.</p>
                  <p>The known familiar Acceſs which the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis Spinola</hi> gave to <hi>Ravillac</hi> at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> the private Entertainments between them a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before that Murderer gave the fatal Blow, together with other Circumſtances, amounted to more than a ſtrong Preſumption with the <hi>French,</hi> that <hi>Spain</hi> was the Principal Author of that Tragedy.</p>
                  <p>And, the ſudden Exclamation of <hi>Franceſco Corvini,</hi> an <hi>Italian Aſtrologer,</hi> the Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King was kill'd, made ſome Men caſt an Eye of Suſpicion beyond the <hi>Alps.</hi> For, he ſtanding on the Leads of his Houſe in <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> as though he were obſerving the Stars, on a ſudden ſtamp'd with his Foot, and ſaid, <hi>To Morrow the Moſt Potent</hi> Monarch <hi>of</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope <hi>will be kill'd.</hi> But ſome curious Heads imagine, he had his Intelligence nearer Hand, than from the Heavens; and, that rather, ſome of the Great <hi>Italian</hi> Stars had made him thus Prophetick.</p>
                  <p>Hence, by comparing theſe Times with thoſe, the preſent <hi>Regency</hi> of a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and Superintendency of an <hi>Italian,</hi> creates a like Suſpicion in the <hi>French,</hi> concerning the Death of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII, who though he died in his Bed, yet might as well be murder'd by a Drug, as his Father was by a Knife. Theſe
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:102956:103"/>are the ſecret Surmiſes of Cabals, not a little heightned by reflecting on the Time of both their Deaths; both dying in the ſame Month, the ſame Day of the Month, and much about the ſame Hour of the Day.</p>
                  <p>Yet, notwithſtanding theſe Murmurs, when his Body was open'd, and his Intrails taken out and ſearch'd, the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> gave their Sentence, That he died a Natural Death. His Bowels are carried to <hi>St. Denis,</hi> a Town above Three Leagues from <hi>Paris,</hi> there to be buried; and his Body is Embalmed in order to its Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulture in the ſame a Place; there being Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Church, where all the <hi>Royal Blood</hi> of <hi>France</hi> is commonly Interr'd.</p>
                  <p>Yeſterday I was in Company with one of his <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> and entring into Diſcourſe of the <hi>King</hi>'s Death, (the common Theme of all Companies at preſent) he told us that the <hi>King</hi>'s Waſting and Death proceeded from the Diſproportion of his Moiſture to his Heat, the latter being predominant in his Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that not meeting with a ſufficient check from Natural Humidity, it kindled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Fevers in his Body, which never left him till he left the World.</p>
                  <p>He was a very devout Man in his Religion, and free from Vice, at leaſt, to outward Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. A remarkable Inſtance of his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety he gave in his Youth; when entring a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Country Village, the better Sort of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants offered to attend him with a Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; he anſwer'd, <hi>I hear you have no</hi> Church <hi>here, neither will I ſuffer a Canopy of</hi> State <hi>to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:102956:104"/>be born over my Head in that Place, where</hi> God <hi>hath not a Conſecrated Roof to dwell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> (For, theſe <hi>Nazarenes</hi> believe, that <hi>God</hi> dwells in their <hi>Temples.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>He was temperate to a Miracle, in the Midſt of <hi>Royal</hi> Dainties; not ſuffering his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to betray his Vertue. He ſcorn'd thoſe Pleaſures which debaſe the Mind. And, took more delight in the noiſe of Drums and Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, and the Roaring of Cannon, than in the ſoft Blandiſhments of Love. He was adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with many other Vertues, which gained him the Love of all, and more eſpecially, the Favour of Heaven. Yet, after all his Victories, Succeſſes and Triumphs, all that can be now ſaid of him is, <hi>He is dead.</hi> Thus paſſes away the Glory of the Greateſt Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates.</p>

King of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Navarre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I need not repeat here, what I have ſaid to them; Becauſe I know, they will commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to thee my Letters.</p>
                  <p>Yet ſuffer me to ſay ſomething of this Great <hi>Monarch,</hi> who had his Nature been more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, would in all probability have exceeded all his <hi>Royal Progenitors,</hi> both in his Conqueſts abroad, and his Abſolute Sway at Home. Of which he gave an early Preſage, appearing at the Head of Armies, at thoſe Years when other Princes are but learning the Rudiments of War in the <hi>Academy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he was little more than Twelve Years of Age, he began to diſcover his Valour and Conduct, in ſubduing the Rebels of <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tou</hi> and <hi>Bretaigne,</hi> leading an Army againſt them in his own Perſon.</p>
                  <p>Yet, that Succeſs, did not diſcourage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his Subjects, from attempting freſh Inſurrections againſt him. <hi>Fate</hi> decreed, that
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:102956:105"/>he ſhould gather the Laurels which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his Crown, from amongſt Briars and Thorns; His whole Life being one continued <hi>Series</hi> of War, either at Home or Abroad, and ſometimes both.</p>
                  <p>But, that which moſt exercis'd his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, was, the frequent <hi>Inteſtine</hi> Broils and Inſurrections of his own Subjects, of which he ſaw no leſs than Ten during his Reign, ſome of them headed and abetted by the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of the <hi>Blood;</hi> Nay, as if Heaven had cut him out for the Toils of War, when all Things elſe were in a Poſture of Peace, his own <hi>Mother</hi> and <hi>Monſieur</hi> his <hi>Brother,</hi> ſeveral Times call'd him into the Field, by taking up Arms againſt him.</p>
                  <p>When Victory had erected <hi>Obelisks</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Monuments of Honour to him in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and had cut Triumphal Arches through the <hi>Alps</hi> and <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains, for the Conquerours Return; when he had made the <hi>Rhine</hi> to flow with <hi>German</hi> Blood, and had every where both by Sea and Land left Tokens of his matchleſs Fortune; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own Country, inſtead of Trophies and Honours to welcome home their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, his Ears were always grated with the unwelcome News of <hi>Civil Wars</hi> in his own Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Yet, he that conſiders, need not wonder at theſe Convulſions of the <hi>State</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> or any other Kingdom ſo populous as that is. In the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe,</hi> though it be governed by an <hi>Eternal Providence</hi> which
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:102956:105"/>cannot err, yet we ſee the <hi>Elements</hi> at war with each other, and that perpetually; and out of this reſtleſs Strife and Quarrel, ariſes the Health and good Conſtitution of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> World. So is it in the <hi>Political</hi> World; No <hi>Kingdom</hi> or <hi>Commonweath</hi> can ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Purgations of her peccant and ſuperfluous Humours; which War effects, as the moſt Appropriate and Natural Remedy in ſuch Caſes.</p>
                  <p>Neither had <hi>Lewis</hi> any great Reaſon to be angry at theſe Diſorders, ſince through his Prudent Management, they furniſh'd him both with the Opportunity and Means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this Kingdom to an entire Obedience, which his <hi>Predeceſſors</hi> could never accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh. Thus, they ſay, the Palm, the more it is oppreſſed with Weights, ſhoots up the higher.</p>

                     <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>Empires,</hi> like <hi>Natural</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, have their proper Time of Growth; and, the <hi>Genius</hi> of each Nation, ſtimulates it with a ſtrong Deſire and Appetite of enlarging its Dominions, which it never ceaſes to purſue, till it be arrived to the Meridian and Height of Grandeur; though it be often interrupted and retarded in its Courſe to Maturity, by <hi>State</hi>-Fevers and other Maladies.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>France,</hi> during the Nonage of her growing <hi>State,</hi> felt various Shocks and Fits; often threatned with a Diſſolution by the high-wrought Blood of potent Factions. Yet, in her Conſtitution, ſhe had Antidotes as well as Poyſons: And, her wiſe Kings, had skill
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:102956:106"/>to check and curb a Popular Diſeaſe. But, none e'er rooted out the Cauſe, till this great <hi>Lewis</hi> took the Cure in Hand. He has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakned all the <hi>Vital</hi> Powers of <hi>State,</hi> and rowz'd the very Soul of <hi>Government.</hi> 'Tis he alone, has cruſh'd the laſt Head of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious <hi>Hydra,</hi> which for ſo many Reigns, had exercis'd the Arms of his <hi>Royal Anceſtors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wouldſt thou know, by what Methods he has accompliſh'd this Great Work? I'll tell thee in a Word; by Rigour and Severity. He fleec'd the <hi>Rich Plebeians</hi> of their Gold, and kept the <hi>Poor</hi> in that Condition, by continual Taxes and Impoſitions.</p>
                  <p>Yet, he was a <hi>Prince</hi> of that admirable Temper in his Government, that he acquired the Epithet of <hi>Juſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His <hi>Queen</hi> is now <hi>Regent,</hi> according to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Dauphin</hi> being but Four Years of Age.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sovereign Arbiter</hi> of <hi>Fate,</hi> grant to the Glorious <hi>Sultan,</hi> Victory over all his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, that ſo, theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> Nations, when their Courſe is run, may be ſubdued to the <hi>Sacred Empire</hi> of the <hi>True Believers.</hi>

                  <head>LETTER XV.</head>
                  <head>
                     <hi>To the</hi> Venerable Mufti, Succeſſor <hi>of the</hi> Prophets, <hi>and</hi> Meſſengers <hi>of</hi> God.</head>
                  <p>THY laſt Letter, has confirmed the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the former; and given me a freſh Teſtimony, of thy <hi>Paternal</hi> Affection and Friendſhip: It is an evident Sign, that thou takeſt Care of poor <hi>Mahmut,</hi> when with an Authority full of Tenderneſs, thou reproveſt his Faults, without leaving him Occaſion to deſpair. Such Reprehenſions, are a Sovereign Balm to a wounded Spirit; and, I hope, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an Application ſweetned with ſo much Clemency, I ſhall never do any Thing which may merit or need the Diſcipline requiſite to a Gangrene.</p>
                  <p>If I was negligent in performing the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> thou before enjoynedſt me, I will now endeavour to make Reparation. If the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I gave thee, of the <hi>Religion</hi> of theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts, was too Superficial and Brief; I will now enlarge, and preſent thee with the Chief Obſervations and Remarks I have made during my Reſidence here, and my Captivity in <hi>Palermo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I need not acquaint thee, with that which cauſes the Greateſt Rupture between the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Churches; <hi>Cyril</hi> the <hi>Patriarch,</hi>
                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:102956:107"/>has ſaid enough to thee on that Subject. Thou knoweſt, that the Grand Quarrel between them is about the <hi>Supremacy,</hi> which the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Prelate</hi> claims over all the <hi>Churches</hi> in the World, by a <hi>Divine</hi> Right. But, neither <hi>Cyril,</hi> nor the <hi>Friars</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with whom he conteſted, would inform thee, that this Supremacy where ever it reſides, is onely founded in <hi>Right</hi> of the <hi>Empire.</hi> They would make thee believe, That the <hi>Chriſtian Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> were, from the Beginning, <hi>Sovereigns,</hi> Eſtabliſhed by <hi>God, Princes</hi> Independent of the <hi>Imperial</hi> Sceptre; concealing, that the Firſt Founders of their pretended <hi>Monarchy,</hi> were poor Fiſhermen, who never dream'd of ſuch a Grandeur, as their Succeſſors were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards inveſted with, by the Liberality of the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperours. It would be a Reproach to themſelves, if they ſhould let thee know, how Holy and Harmleſs were the Firſt <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of <hi>Byzantium</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> who refuſed the Honours and Dignities of the World, and were only Ambitious of Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling one another in Vertue and a Pious Life. Their very Addreſſes to thee, are a Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Examples of their Predeceſſors, each Party offering Treaſures of Gold, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bribe the Incorruptible Judge with the glittering Dirt. Aſſuredly, the Seeds of an Irreconcilable Diſcord are ſown in theſe <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels;</hi> they are ſetled upon the Lees of Error, till the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the State of Controverſie between them, it is certain, that while <hi>Rome</hi> was the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:102956:107"/>
                     <hi>Capital Seat</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> the <hi>Roman Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> had the Superiority granted them; but, when the <hi>Imperial Reſidence</hi> was tranſlated from thence to <hi>Byzantium,</hi> by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> (from whom it derives the Name it now bears of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>) then the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical</hi> Supremacy was alſo transferr'd to the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of that City; who enjoys it to this Day, through the Favour of our Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent <hi>Sultans,</hi> who ſucceed the Ancient <hi>Emperours</hi> of <hi>Greece.</hi> This Superlative Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> would not recognize in any other but themſelves, being loath to part with the Authority they once poſſeſs'd; whence proceeded the <hi>Schiſm</hi> between the Two <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt.</hi> And, while the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> ſhelter'd their new acquir'd Honour, under the Protection of the <hi>Emperours;</hi> the <hi>Popes,</hi> partly by Artifice and partly by Force, made themſelves <hi>Lords</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Adjacent Territories, taking Advantage of the <hi>Abſence</hi> of the <hi>Emperours,</hi> the <hi>Puſillanimity</hi> of the <hi>Senators,</hi> and <hi>Diſcord</hi> of the <hi>Citizens.</hi> Supported with this <hi>Princely</hi> Eſtate, they <hi>Excommunicate</hi> all the <hi>Churches</hi> which did not ſubmit to them, as the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Prelates</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> World; pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing ſevere <hi>Edicts</hi> againſt the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> and doing every Thing that might confirm the World, in the Belief of their Authority and Grandeur. The <hi>Potentates</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> frightned with the Thunder which the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Pontifs</hi> uſed, and induced by other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, did Homage to them, acknowledging
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:102956:108"/>their <hi>Sovereign</hi> Juriſdiction in the <hi>Weſt.</hi> In this State they have continued ever ſince, without yielding in any Thing to the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There have been great Endeavours uſed on both Sides, to gain their reſpective Ends; and, ſeveral <hi>General Councils</hi> were called, that is, an Aſſembly of the Chief <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> of both <hi>Churches,</hi> to examine and decide the Difference. And, ſometimes the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> have ſubſcribed a Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the <hi>Pope;</hi> but, as ſoon as they return'd home, they have Recanted, and the Breach render'd as wide as ever. They accuſe the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> of Partiality, and ſay, That the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi> were pack'd; yet, both Parties ſeem to give an extraordinary Deference to theſe <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils,</hi> believing, That the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is there preſent, and guides them into all Truth. The <hi>Councils</hi> which they eſteem <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi> have <hi>contradicted</hi> each other: This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing what That had Decreed, and a Third Diſannulling that Repeal. The <hi>Councils</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve themſelves above the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> exalts himſelf above the <hi>Councils.</hi> Sometimes they have Two or Three <hi>Popes</hi> together, all claiming that, which can be the Right but of One. In fine, they have involved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſuch a Labyrinth of Diſputes and Cavils, and are entangl'd in ſuch a Circle of Abſurdities, that the ſoberer part of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> begin to queſtion the Authority both of <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Councils:</hi> Inſomuch, as it being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally known, that the laſt Aſſembly of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:102956:108"/>this Kind, was manifeſtly over-ruled by the Agents of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> people ſpar'd not to paſs this Jeſt on it, and ſay, <hi>That the</hi> Holy Ghoſt <hi>was ſent from</hi> Rome <hi>to the</hi> Council <hi>of</hi> Trent <hi>in a</hi> Cloak-bag; intimating thereby, the many Inſtructions and Advices which were continually tranſmitted from <hi>Rome</hi> by the Poſt, to the <hi>Fathers</hi> ſitting in that <hi>Council,</hi> whereby all things were determined according to the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Pleaſure, and to the Advantage of the <hi>Roman Court.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis certain, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> now-adays, have abated much of that <hi>Blind Obedience,</hi> which they formerly paid to the <hi>Roman Pontifs:</hi> they begin to ſee with their own Eyes, and not with thoſe of their <hi>Prieſts.</hi> There was a Time, when many Kings were made to hold their <hi>Crowns</hi> in Fee of the <hi>Roman Prelate,</hi> who pretended a Right to diſpoſe of all the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms</hi> and <hi>Empires</hi> of the Earth, as <hi>Vicar</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> But, the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England, Suede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> with ſome <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>German Empire</hi> and the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> have taught others the Way to ſtand upon their Guard; ſo that, though the <hi>Emperour</hi> of <hi>Germany, Kings</hi> of <hi>France, Spain</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> with the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> profeſs an Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the <hi>Holy Father,</hi> yet 'tis rather out of a <hi>Maxim</hi> of <hi>Policy,</hi> than any real Perſwaſion of Religion.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeem the moſt ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly Devoted to the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet, they will not endure the <hi>Excommunication,</hi> which the <hi>Pope</hi> pronounces againſt their King, above
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:102956:109"/>the Space of one Day: It ſeems, upon ſome old Difference between them, it is uſual for the <hi>Holy Father</hi> to <hi>Excommunicate</hi> this <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign</hi> once a Year, that is, on the <hi>Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> before <hi>Eaſter,</hi> which is the ſame as our <hi>Feaſt</hi> of <hi>Beiram.</hi> Now, as I am told, the <hi>Spaniſh Ambaſſador</hi> next Day, preſents the <hi>Pope</hi> with a Gennet or Horſe, upon which the Cenſure is taken off. This is an <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick</hi> Juggle; and the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> uſe a great deal of ſuch <hi>Holy Legerdemain,</hi> to keep the Sons of the <hi>Church</hi> in their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French Church,</hi> though in all Things agreeing and profeſſing an entire Obedience to the <hi>Roman,</hi> yet claims to her ſelf ſome Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities and Privileges, which the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is very loath to grant. Hence it comes to paſs, that there ariſe frequent Conteſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Popes</hi> and the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> which are generally accommodated to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Latter; the <hi>Pope</hi> not being willing to try the Force, of <hi>THE LAST REASON OF KINGS:</hi> This is a <hi>Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> engraven on the <hi>French</hi> King's Cannon, which he has threatned to carry to the Walls of <hi>Rome,</hi> if the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould entrench on the <hi>Gallican</hi> Rights.</p>
                  <p>But, though they thus diſagree in ſome Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceties of State, yet they and all the Reſt of the Nations, within the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, have but one <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Divine</hi> Service, which they call the <hi>Maſs,</hi> and it is the ſame with the <hi>Grecian Liturgy.</hi> On <hi>Feſtival</hi> Days, it
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:102956:109"/>is ſolemnized with Variety of Choice <hi>Muſick</hi> and <hi>Singing;</hi> with Innumerable Wax-Tapers, burning at Noon-day. I have ſeen at ſuch a Time, Sixteen <hi>Prieſts</hi> before the <hi>Altar,</hi> all Veſted in moſt coſtly Silks, embroidered with Gold and Pearls.</p>
                  <p>They have alſo many <hi>Chappels</hi> and <hi>Altars</hi> in the ſame <hi>Church,</hi> and ſometimes they Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate <hi>Maſs</hi> on all the <hi>Altars</hi> together; dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering herein from thoſe of the <hi>Greek Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> who have but one <hi>Altar</hi> in a <hi>Temple:</hi> For which they plead Antiquity, it never ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been known, that the <hi>Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> had any more. On the other ſide, the <hi>Romans</hi> plead Conveniency, for the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of their <hi>Altars,</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> has a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to diſpenſe with the Ancient Rites and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions in ſuch Caſes; and, that nothing was more reaſonable, than that their <hi>Altars</hi> ſhould be multiplied, as the Number of their <hi>Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> encreas'd.</p>
                  <p>I will not pretend to decide this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; permit me only to ſay, that the <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Muſſulmans,</hi> have more reaſon to require ſeveral <hi>Preachers</hi> at the ſame time in our <hi>Magnificent Moſques,</hi> where it is impoſſible for all the Auditors in ſo vaſt an Aſſembly, to hear and underſtand the <hi>Law</hi> Expounded by one Man, though it be performed in the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Tongue: Whereas, their Service is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in a Language, whereof the Multitude are utterly ignorant. It matters not much, whether they are near the <hi>Prieſt</hi> at the <hi>Altar,</hi> or afar off, ſince they underſtand not a Word
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:102956:110"/>he ſays; and, the <hi>Grecians</hi> judge it ſufficient, to be preſent at this their Daily <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> tho it be at the very Porch of the Temple.</p>
                  <p>Another Difference there is alſo between theſe Two <hi>Churches;</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> allows not a <hi>Married Prieſt,</hi> unleſs in ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Caſes, and then the <hi>Pope's Diſpenſation</hi> muſt be procured. But, <hi>Concubinage</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived at, though forbidden by the <hi>Cannons</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> Whereas thou knoweſt, that all the <hi>Grecian Papa's;</hi> marry and get Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> among all the Nations within the <hi>Roman Pale,</hi> are reckon'd the <hi>Beſt Catholicks,</hi> but the <hi>Worſt Chriſtians;</hi> the <hi>French</hi> are ſaid to be, the <hi>Beſt Chriſtians,</hi> but the <hi>Worſt Catholicks;</hi> and, the <hi>Italians,</hi> are accounted neither <hi>Catholicks</hi> nor <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know not what reaſon they have to ſtate the Difference ſo between the Two Former; but, the Character of the Latter, ſuits in one Reſpect with the uſual <hi>Proverb</hi> of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; it being common in the Mouths of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Gallants,</hi> to ſay, <hi>He that is a</hi> Chriſtian <hi>is a</hi> Fool.</p>
                  <p>The Devouter ſort of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> pay a great Reverence and Devotion to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques</hi> of their <hi>Saints.</hi> I could not reprehend them for this, if I were ſure of Two Things, That all thoſe whom they eſteem as <hi>Saints</hi> were really ſuch; and, That all the <hi>Reliques</hi> they keep with ſo much Veneration in their <hi>Churches,</hi> did really appertain to the Perſons under whoſe Names they go: For, then it
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:102956:110"/>would be no more, than what the <hi>True Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers</hi> practiſe throughout the World; and it is well known, That when a piece of the Garment of our <hi>Holy Prophet,</hi> was dipt in the Water which they caſt on the Flames of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> the Fire immediately ceaſed, to which before no Stop could be given by all the Induſtry and Endeavours of Men. Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly, the Bodies of the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> are <hi>Holy,</hi> and have a Power of Sanctifying whatever they touch, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing often Miraculous Effects; but, the Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice of Men may abuſe this Truth to their own private Ends; and, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will not believe all to be <hi>true Reliques</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> which their Crafty <hi>Prieſts</hi> ſhew for ſuch.</p>
                  <p>There be innumerable other <hi>Sects</hi> of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> which are neither in <hi>Communion</hi> with the <hi>Roman</hi> nor the <hi>Grecian Churches;</hi> but, accuſing them of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> ſeparate themſelves from their Society, and form Diſtinct Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. Theſe are not known in <hi>France,</hi> ſaving only the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> Which laſt, is a <hi>Term</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending all that have Revolted from the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and was firſt aſſumed by the <hi>Lutherans</hi> at <hi>Ausburgh</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> there are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of theſe <hi>Sects,</hi> ſome of them newly ſprung up, others of longer Date. And, all thus far agree with the <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> that they uſe not <hi>Pictures</hi> or <hi>Images</hi> in their <hi>Temples;</hi> ſo, that were they rightly inſtructed in the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:102956:111"/>
                     <hi>Holy Alcoran,</hi> it would not be a Thing alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether impracticable, to perſwade them to <hi>Circumciſion.</hi> There is a <hi>Sect</hi> which they call <hi>Socinians,</hi> who ſeem to preach out of the very <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Glory,</hi> denying the <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Mary,</hi> the <hi>Chriſtians Meſſias;</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as our <hi>Divine Lawgiver</hi> does in ſeveral <hi>Chapters</hi> and <hi>Verſicles</hi> of the <hi>Alcoran.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> ſeems to be a ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Building, whereof <hi>Prelacy</hi> is the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-Stone; if this were removed, all would fall to the Ground. That which they call the <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> if it could once be diſſolv'd or pull'd down, we ſhould ſoon ſee all <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> laid in Ruines. This <hi>Hierarchy</hi> is a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Subordination of <hi>Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Prieſts;</hi> the Inferiour depending on the Superiour, and all deriving their Orders and Dignities from their <hi>Chief Patriarchs.</hi> Theſe are the Links which compoſe that Chain, that faſtens <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> together; were this but once broke, the United Intereſt of <hi>Europe</hi> would ſoon fall into pieces. The Way muſt be, by beginning at the lowermoſt Link: Could but the <hi>Prieſts</hi> be render'd Independent on the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and on each other, it would be a fair ſtep toward the diſmantling of the Out-works, theſe <hi>Prieſts</hi> drawing infinite Numbers of People after them; as it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in <hi>Geneva, Holland, Suiſſerland</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Places, where they have quite aboliſh'd the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Biſhops:</hi> And it is obſervable, that none of theſe foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Countries ſince that Time, have ever
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:102956:111"/>been Inſtrumental in oppoſing the Victorious Arms of the <hi>Ottoman Empire;</hi> As, if, with the Downfal of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> the Charm were diſſipated, which had for ſome Ages precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated theſe Nations (among others) to a raſh and Obſtinate Reſiſtance of that Force, which is deſtin'd by <hi>Fate,</hi> to Conquer and Reform the World.</p>
                  <p>Weigh this Thought well, and thou wilt find, that the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> is Eſſential and Neceſſary to the Good Eſtate of <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> and, that the onely Way for the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulmans</hi> to undermine all <hi>Europe,</hi> will be, to ſupplant this <hi>Order,</hi> and Introduce an <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick</hi> Independency among the <hi>Prieſts;</hi> by which means, every one ſhall aſſume to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not onely his proper Fragment of the torn Dignity, but the whole Fundamental Power of a <hi>Biſhop;</hi> taking upon him to do thoſe Offices, which before it was not accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Lawful for any but a <hi>Mitred</hi> Head to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. Hence, in Time, will follow innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Inconveniences, Diſtaſtes, and Broils; and, perhaps, as many <hi>Schiſms,</hi> as there are particular <hi>Prieſts</hi> to head them: Since, every one will be apt to think himſelf capable of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctating to all the Reſt, and judge it below him to receive the <hi>Law</hi> from any. Thus, will there be a clear Stage, for Ambition, Avarice and Luſt, to act their Parts on; and when, by the Craft of deſigning Men, the Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bigots, and the Eaſineſs of the Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, the greateſt Part ſhall be ſo divided, that it will be difficult to find Two Men of the

                  <p>One Day, ſeeing the Guards, as they were exerciſing their Arms, he diſcovered an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Complacency, and ſaid to thoſe that ſtood by; <hi>I had rather be a Soldier, than a King:</hi> Imagining, from the Softneſſes he is accuſtomed to in theſe Infant Years, that the Life of a <hi>Soldier,</hi> is incompatible with that of a <hi>King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Since that Time, he haraſſes his Tutor and

                  <p>The <hi>Iſland</hi> of <hi>Tercera,</hi> was the only Place that held out againſt the <hi>New King,</hi> when all others, with Expreſſions of extraordinary Joy for their Deliverance from the <hi>Caſtilian</hi> Yoke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſubmitted to and acknowledg'd <hi>D.

                  <p>The Reſiſtance which the <hi>Governor</hi> of this <hi>Iſland</hi> made, obliged the King to ſend thither a certain Number of Ships of War, to block up the Place, and hinder the Importance of any Proviſions. And, this courſe prov'd ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful; for, though the <hi>Spaniards</hi> attempted ſeveral Times to relieve it, yet their Veſſels were either taken by the <hi>Portugueze</hi> Fleet, or ſent back again without doing their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand. So that at length, <hi>Dom Alvaro de Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiros,</hi> the <hi>Governor,</hi> finding himſelf reduced to great Streights for want of Neceſſaries, without any Hopes of being relieved, was forced to Capitulate and Surrender.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>New King</hi> has made an <hi>Allyance</hi> with the <hi>Suedes,</hi> which is of no ſmall Advantage to him; having thereby eſtabliſhed a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with that Country, and furniſhing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from thence with Powder, Horſes, Arms and all other Proviſions of War.</p>
                  <p>He has alſo made a <hi>Treaty</hi> with the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> but not with ſo good Succeſs as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Thou haſt heard what Poſſeſſions the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> have acquired in <hi>America,</hi> they being the firſt Diſcoverers of that <hi>New World.</hi> It happened, that about the Time of the late Revolution in <hi>Portugal,</hi> the <hi>Hollanders</hi> of <hi>Braſil</hi> took from the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueze</hi> the Towns of <hi>Angola,</hi> St. <hi>Thomas, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragnon</hi> and other Places belonging to <hi>D.

The Knowledge of this coming to the <hi>Portugueze Court,</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the King to ſend his <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the <hi>States</hi> the Reaſon of this Breach.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:102956:114"/>They anſwer, It was done before the News of the <hi>Revolution</hi> had reached the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> This, with ſome Acts of Hoſtility in the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riental</hi> Parts, has leſſen'd the good Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which was between them.</p>
                  <p>In the mean Time, the Spight and Hatred of the <hi>Caſtilians,</hi> encreaſed daily; much Blood was ſpilt on the Frontiers of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which obliged <hi>D. Juan</hi> to eſtabliſh Six Places of Strength, quartering in them an Army of Thirty Thouſand Men. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe theſe Forces, had likewiſe Four or Five Armies in <hi>Caſtile.</hi> There were many Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes and Encounters, Stratagems and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcades on both Sides; and, it was hard to determine who had got the Advantage, till Fortune ſeem'd to favour the Cauſe of the <hi>Portugueze.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They had a Valiant and Expert Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who was <hi>Governour</hi> of one of their Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier <hi>Provinces;</hi> his Name is, <hi>Fernand Telles de Menezez.</hi> This <hi>Hero</hi> animated by the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of his Cauſe, and ſpurr'd on by the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ardour of his Spirit, pierc'd into the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of <hi>Old Caſtile,</hi> took the Towns of <hi>St. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> and <hi>Elges,</hi> demoliſhing the Caſtle belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the latter, which alſo commanded all the Country thereabouts; and, being encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd by Two Thouſand Five Hundred <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> he fell upon them and cut them all in Pieces. He alſo render'd himſelf Maſter of a ſtrong Place call'd <hi>Valverde,</hi> which he ſtor'd with all ſorts of Ammunition, and left a <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueze</hi> Garriſon in it.</p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:102956:114"/>
                  <p>They were no leſs Victorious in another <hi>Province,</hi> from whence the <hi>Portugueze</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ruſh'd into the Adjacent Territories of <hi>Spain,</hi> taking the Towns of <hi>Aroches, Villar de Rey, Codicere, Anzinaſola,</hi> and other Places of Note, without any Reſiſtance, ſave that of a few <hi>Caſtilian</hi> Troops, moſt of which they took Priſoners, with a Booty or three Hundred <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gennets. After this, they took <hi>Chelles</hi> by Storm, one of the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Towns in that Part of <hi>Spain.</hi> Nor was the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> onely thus ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful near Home, but his Affairs proſper'd alſo abroad. The Kings of <hi>Goa</hi> and <hi>Maroc</hi> ſought his Alliance, with other Princes in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> and, in General, all the <hi>Potentates</hi> in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> excepting onely <hi>Spain,</hi> made Friendſhip with <hi>D. Juan de Braganza,</hi> and eſpouſed his Intereſts.</p>
                  <p>There has been a General Aſſembly of all the <hi>Eſtates</hi> of <hi>Portugal;</hi> wherein, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have teſtified their Joy and Satisfaction in their <hi>New King,</hi> by offering him, together with their Lives, the Diſpoſal of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, to be imployed for the Service of the <hi>Crown,</hi> and the Releaſe of his Royal Brother <hi>Dom Duartus,</hi> of whom I formerly made Mention in one of my Letters.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt not perhaps think me trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, if I relate to thee how the <hi>Spaniards</hi> uſed this unfortunate Prince after they had Impriſon'd him: Neither is it altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, to let thee ſee, how ſpightful this Nation is in their Revenges, and how Cruel
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:102956:115"/>in the Execution of their Reſentments.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Dom Duartus</hi> was delivered into the Hands of the <hi>Marquis Caſtel Rodrigo,</hi> the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> gave him not the Entertainment and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect due to a Prince, but uſed him like a Slave or Malefactor, cauſing him to be lodged in a mean dark Chamber, his Hands to be chained every Night, his Robes to be taken from him, none of his Domeſticks ſuffered to come near him, and doing all the Indignities to him that their Malice could ſuggeſt, as proper means to render his Impriſonment intolerable, and his Life a Burden. If thou askeſt me, for what Crime it was they thus puniſhed him, I can tell thee of none, unleſs it were one, to be ſo nearly related to the King of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, this is not the only Example of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cruelty; they executed their Revenge on poor unarm'd Peaſants in the Field, the <hi>Duke d' Alva</hi> cauſing Three Hundred <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueze</hi> Husbandmen, as they were labouring in the Vineyards, to be murdered in cold Blood, ſacrificing them, as he ſaid, to the <hi>Choſts</hi> of the ſlaughter'd <hi>Caſtilians.</hi> And, it was attributed to their under hand Inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that four <hi>Portugueze</hi> Ambaſſadors, with Three and Fifty of their Train, were barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly put to Death by the <hi>Japoneſes,</hi> againſt the Law of Nature, and the Sanction of all Nations. Such Violences have never been practis'd in the <hi>Ottoman Empire;</hi> the <hi>Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> has not been prophan'd by an Injuſtice of ſo deep a Die.</p>
                  <p>There has been lately diſcover'd, a Second
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:102956:115"/>Conſpiracy againſt <hi>Dom Juan de Braganza,</hi> wherein were concerned <hi>Dom Joſeph de Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zez, Governour</hi> of St. <hi>Julien,</hi> the moſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Fortreſs of all the Kingdom, and <hi>Dom Franciſco de Lucena, Secretary</hi> of <hi>State.</hi> Theſe held a private Correſpondence with the <hi>Duke d' Olivares;</hi> and, it was agreed between them, that the <hi>Governour</hi> of <hi>Badaiox,</hi> a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſhould be put in Poſſeſſion of St. <hi>Julian</hi>'s <hi>Fort,</hi> which is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Key of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and that other Places of Strength ſhould be delivered up to ſuch <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Officers as <hi>Olivares</hi> appointed. But, a Letter which was ſent from <hi>Dom Juan de Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray, Governour</hi> of <hi>Badaiox,</hi> to the <hi>Governour</hi> of St. <hi>Lucies-Fort</hi> in <hi>Portugal,</hi> being by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake carried to the Hands of the <hi>Count d' Obi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos,</hi> a <hi>Portugueze General,</hi> and a faithful Friend to the King, diſcovered the Intrigue, and the Traytors were ſeized and brought to Condign Puniſhment.</p>

                  <p>THOU wilt wonder when I tell thee, I am melancholy for want of Solitude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That which adminiſters Occaſion of Sadneſs to others, is the onely Cure of my Grief. Yet, this will not ſeem a <hi>Paradox,</hi> when thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereſt, that Converſation is the Air of the Soul, and that he who values the Health and Eaſe of his Mind, ought to chuſe ſuch an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for it to breathe in, as is pure and ſerene, which is very Difficult to find in any Society. This is the Reaſon, that I never think my ſelf more alone, than when I am confin'd to ſome Kind of Company.</p>
                  <p>Thou haſt obſerved, that moſt Men will engroſs all the Talk to themſelves; this is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Irkſom. Yet, I ſhould not grudge them the Monopoly, were their Diſcourſe pertinent and agreeable; but, to be forc'd to hearken to all their empty Tattle of Hawks and Hounds, Garbs and Faſhions, with an endleſs Jargon of Things leſs to the Purpoſe than the former, which will keep their Tongues employ'd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times two or three Hours together; renders their Converſe more troubleſome, than that of the Spark, who pick'd up <hi>Horace</hi> in the Streets of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others are of a quite contrary Humour; and, thou mayſt as ſoon get a Word from
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:102956:116"/>the <hi>Mufti,</hi> as from them. They ſit like Statues, as if they emulated the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of <hi>Griuli Eben Sagran,</hi> one of the <hi>Vizirs</hi> of the <hi>Bench,</hi> who in ten Years that he had ſat in the <hi>Divan,</hi> was never obſerved to ſpeak a Syllable.</p>
                  <p>Yet, this ſort is more tolerable than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who with their Everlaſting Chat, rock the Company aſleep, and take from them the very Power of Thinking.</p>
                  <p>However, I prefer the Retirement of my Chamber, to both theſe Inconveniences. There I can enter into my ſelf, and by retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from all Commerce with my Senſes, I find a private Back Way to converſe with the whole Univerſe. Think not this a <hi>Chimaera,</hi> or that <hi>Mahmut</hi> pretends to extraordinary Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; 'tis nothing but what every Man may experience, who will but take the Pains to be throughly acquainted with Himſelf. If he can but gain a familiar Acceſs to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Apartments of his own Breaſt, he will ſoon find a Poſtern there, which will readily open and let him into the moſt retired Cloſets of Nature: From thence he may ſally forth, and take a better Survey of the World, than he can by his Eyes. Here he will behold all Things undiſguiſed, and in their true Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities and Qualities. And, which is more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, he will be able, without the Help of <hi>Opticks,</hi> to ſee himſelf enjoying this Felicity, and to know that he ſees it, which is a ſufficient Conviction, that he is not in a Dream.</p>
                  <p>Wouldſt thou improve thy Knowledge,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:102956:117"/>affect not a Multitude of Books; there are but few worth the Reading. What is the whole Creation, but one Great Library; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Volume in which, and every Page in thoſe Volumes, are impreſs'd with Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Characters of infinite Wiſdom? And, all the Perfections of the Univerſe, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with ſuch unimitable Art in Man, that he needs no other Book but himſelf, to make him a complete <hi>Philoſopher.</hi> Thou wilt ſay, that this requires too great an Abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of Mind, and is very painful. I tell thee, my dear Friend, I am extremely ſubject to Melancholy; whoſe Effect, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, is to render one very thoughtful, and thoſe Thoughts rack the Soul with intolerable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh. Yet I do not fly from them, as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Men are accuſtom'd, neither do I ſeek to drown them in Wine, or chaſe them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with any Sociable Divertiſements. My uſual Way is, to bid them Battel, oppoſe Thoughts againſt Thoughts; and, with the Dint of Reaſon, to ſubdue this peeviſh Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. To this End, I hunt up and down for my Enemy, and rummage every Corner of my Soul, purſuing the Cauſe of my Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with ſuch Arguments as theſe: Why ſhould I be melancholy, who poſſeſs Nothing that I fear to loſe, and yet enjoy all that I could wiſh for, were I without what I now Poſſeſs? I am a <hi>Muſſulman,</hi> and therefore under the Protection of <hi>God:</hi> I ſerve his <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent,</hi> the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> faithfully, and find Acceptance with the <hi>Baſſa's</hi> of the <hi>Port:</hi> I am
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:102956:117"/>in <hi>France,</hi> yet cannot call it a <hi>Foreign</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſince Innocence and Vertue naturalize a Man in all Parts of the World. I cannot ſay I am unfortunate, ſo long as I have no Vice, for which I need either to Bluſh, or grow Pale. If I am ſlander'd, this ought to be an Occaſion of Joy, ſince it ranks me with Men of the Greateſt Merit, who could never eſcape the Calumnies of the Envious. And, I have reaſon to Triumph, in that I find no Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to revenge my ſelf, but rather to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty my Traducers. If any Man ſhould play the <hi>Satyriſt</hi> with my Deformity, and rudely deſcant on my Ugly Countenance, or the Diſproportion of my Limbs; there is no more Reaſon to be grieved at this, than to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted at the Wind for blowing off my Hat, or the Rain for wetting my Cloaths, or a Dog for barking at me as I go along the Streets, the one being as Natural as the other.</p>
                  <p>Thus I argue with my ſelf, Dear <hi>Oglou,</hi> when aſſaulted with Melancholy; theſe are the Remedies which I apply to that black Diſtemper of the Mind: And ſometimes I go farther, if theſe will do no good: I then ask my ſelf, whether it be the fear of Death that thus perplexes me? And here begins my Cure. This kindles the Brighteſt Spark of Reaſon, which in a Moment diſperſes all the Miſts. The diſmal Pageantry of <hi>Chimera's</hi> vaniſhes, and all the Tragick Pomp of Grief ſtreight diſappear. Not, that I would have thee think I am fond of dying, but I conſider <hi>Death</hi> as the <hi>unavoidable Fate</hi> of all Men
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:102956:118"/>and, that therefore it is reaſonable to be chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſince that which no Man can eſcape, will one Time or other, releaſe me and every Man from the Miſeries of this Life. This Thought recovers me from the worſt Effects of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly; and, I believe, the <hi>Damned</hi> themſelves would ſometimes be in a good Humour, if they had but the leaſt Glimpſe of Hope, that they ſhould one Day be deliver'd from their Torments. For, whatſoever ſorts of Men there are in this Life, I cannot think, <hi>there be any</hi> Stoicks <hi>in Hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now I have entertained thee with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and Solitude, with Books and Men, with Life and Death, with Earth and Hell; let us take one Step farther, and refreſh our ſelves with the Remembrance of Heaven, the Joys of the Bleſs'd in <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> which, certainly is the beſt Relief of Anxious Thoughts, the moſt perfect Cure of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, the Guide of Life, and the Comfort of Death.</p>

                     <hi>KIngdoms</hi> and <hi>Empires</hi> (like Men) have their Lucky and Unlucky Seaſons. <hi>Spain</hi> ſeems for a conſiderable Time to have been under a Cloud, as if her <hi>Guardian Fate</hi> began to droop, and were not ſtrong enough to check the riſing Grandeur of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It has been an old Obſervation, <hi>That thoſe whom</hi> God <hi>conſigns over to Ruine, he firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuates.</hi> It was a Grand Overſight in <hi>Don Franciſco de Melo,</hi> to conſtitute the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Alburquerque, General</hi> of his <hi>Horſe.</hi> For, he thereby ſo diſguſted the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Officers in his Army, that emulating the Honour of this young <hi>Portugueze,</hi> the greateſt Part of them deſerted, in the very Nick of Time, when their Preſence was moſt neceſſary to confirm the <hi>Battalions,</hi> already ſhrinking from the furious Onſet of the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This gave the young <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Anguien,</hi> an intire Victory, and has crowned him with glorious Laurels; while <hi>Don Franciſco de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> by this ill Conduct, has quite loſt his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and is forced to reſign up his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> to another.</p>
                  <p>This Battle was fought before <hi>Rocroy,</hi> and may be reckoned as a Parallel with that Bloody Battel of <hi>Leipſick,</hi> between the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts</hi> and <hi>Suedes,</hi> on the 7th. of the 9th.

                     <hi>Moon,</hi> of the Year 1631. A Day which was remarkable at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> on the Account of that terrible Lightning, which ſurprized the late <hi>Sultan Amurath</hi> in his Bed. Many other extraordinary Events ſignalized this Day in <hi>England, France, Germany,</hi> and other places, which occaſioned the great <hi>Aſtrologer Herlici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> to call it, <hi>a Day of Blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such another was this Unfortunate Day to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> at the forementioned Battel of <hi>Rocroy;</hi> where they loſt an infinite Number of Men, with all their Field-pieces and a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Fifty Colours.</p>

                     <hi>To the</hi> Vizir Azem, <hi>at the</hi> Port.</head>
                  <p>IT is Time, it is high time, moſt Sage <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,</hi> for the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Sword, the Sword of Juſtice to be unſheathed, not againſt an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Enemy, but againſt its profeſſed Friends and Subjects. The Head of the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus,</hi> is become a Burden to him; as likewiſe, thoſe of <hi>Mitylene, Sio</hi> and <hi>Lemnos.</hi> They plot Miſchief, againſt the Throne that is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in Equity; they are ungrateful to their Sovereign, who hath exalted them; they are become unworthy of the Honours, with which they are dignified.</p>
                  <p>I could hardly believe the firſt Reports of this Treaſon, till I were at length fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by undeniable Teſtimonies, that it was too true.</p>
                  <p>Yet, it is a Secret even in the <hi>French Court.</hi> I alone have diſcover'd this Myſtery, by the Means of a <hi>Jew</hi> and a <hi>Grecian,</hi> both my Agents in thoſe Parts, and Men whom I can confide in.</p>
                  <p>The Buſineſs is this. The <hi>Baſſa's</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours</hi> of the <hi>Iſles</hi> before-mentioned, have conſpired together to divide themſelves from the Body of the <hi>Ottoman Empire,</hi> and to make the <hi>Iſlands</hi> of the <hi>Aegean</hi> Sea, a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> Independent on the <hi>Throne</hi> which governs the <hi>World.</hi> The <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> is the Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leader
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:102956:120"/>of this Conſpiracy, and that <hi>Iſland</hi> is to be the <hi>Capital Seat</hi> of their <hi>New Republick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Governours</hi> of the Five Greater <hi>Iſles,</hi> are to be called, <hi>the Sovereign Counſellors of State.</hi> By theſe, all the Affairs of the <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelago</hi> are to be managed. Onely the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Cyprus</hi> ſhall be ſupreme, and have the caſting Voice in all Caſes of Diſpute.</p>
                  <p>The encloſed Papers, contain the perfect Model of their New Government, the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Propoſitions on which this Rebellious deſigned <hi>Commonwealth</hi> is to be built, with the Names of the Chief Conſpirators ſubſcribed.</p>
                  <p>Permit me, Sage <hi>Miniſter,</hi> to ſet before thy Eyes, the Occaſions of theſe Treacherous Deſigns.</p>
                  <p>It has been the Cuſtom of the <hi>Port,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive for a conſiderable time at the Oppreſſions, Rapines, and Exactions of the <hi>Baſſa's</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours</hi> of <hi>Provinces;</hi> to ſuffer them to haraſs the People under their Juriſdiction; to pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage and ſpoil them of their Moneys, Goods and Eſtates; till they have amaſs'd together vaſt Sums of Money. And then, it has been as uſual for the <hi>Sultans,</hi> upon the leaſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, to ſend the Bow-String to the Criminal <hi>Baſſa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whatever may be pleaded in Defence of this Method in former Times, my Opinion is, that it may prove dangerous now. And, if I may be permitted to ſpeak freely, I have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think, that this was one Ground of the deſigned Treaſon in the <hi>Iſles</hi> of the <hi>Aegean</hi> Sea.</p>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:102956:120"/>
                  <p>Formerly, thoſe who were removed to theſe Commands, were not ſo well verſed in the <hi>Maxims</hi> of <hi>Policy,</hi> nor ſo apprehenſive of the <hi>Cabinet Secrets</hi> of <hi>State.</hi> But now the Age is refined, Men are more ſubtle, jealous and ſelfiſh than they were. Nature teaches all Men to preſerve their Lives with utmoſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> who is the Ring-lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of this Conſpiracy, has been let alone in a long Courſe of Tyranny and Oppreſſion over his Subjects; by which means, he has heap'd to himſelf prodigious Treaſures. His guilty Mind told him, that Complaints would be made againſt him, and that one time or other he muſt be ſtrangled. He knew, that his Gold would be thought better to become the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's Seraglio</hi> than his own; and, that he had been long enough in his Office, to ſerve the Politick Ends of State.</p>
                  <p>Revolving theſe things in his Mind, he quickly concluded, that the Crimes he had been guilty of in his Government, would draw upon him inevitable Ruine, unleſs he prevented it by committing greater. And that, as Oppreſſion of his Subjects had made him Rich, ſo Treaſon againſt his Sovereign muſt make him ſafe. He communicates his thoughts, to ſome of his truſty Friends and Confidents. They encourage him to proceed, repreſenting to him the Natural Strength of the <hi>Iſland,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by Abundance of ſtrong Forts and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. That the Soldiers might eaſily be won to his Party by Money, and the Inhabitants
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:102956:121"/>might be pacified by ſome Publick Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and other Acts of Indulgence.</p>
                  <p>Thus was the Foundation laid of this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Treaſon, which ſoon gathered Strength by the Acceſſion of more Conſpirators, till at length all the <hi>Iſles</hi> aforeſaid were engaged in the Diſloyal League.</p>
                  <p>I will not preſume to dictate what is to be done in this Caſe. I leave that to thy Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Sentence. But, permit me to ſuggeſt my Thoughts, of a proper means to prevent the like Miſcarriages for the future. And that is, by executing timely and Impartial Juſtice. It ſeems to me, not only a Reflection on the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of the <hi>Imperial</hi> Sword, but alſo on the <hi>Politicks</hi> of the <hi>Royal</hi> Cabinet, to ſuffer a <hi>Baſſa</hi> to grow Rich by Oppreſſion of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under his Command. For, when he has thus plunder'd his Subjects to fill his own Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, he has armed himſelf with the very Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news and Nerves of Rebellion; Money being that, which gives Life and Motion to all great and bold Undertakings.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, it will be better, not to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the leaſt Oppreſſion in theſe great Men, whereby they may at once be tempted, through the Conſcientiouſneſs of their Crimes, and ſtrengthen'd by their ill gotten Wealth, to Rebel againſt their Lawful <hi>Sovereign.</hi> Let <hi>Aleppo, Sidon, Algiers, Tunis</hi> and <hi>Tripoly,</hi> be Precedents of this Kind. By <hi>Juſtice</hi> the <hi>Throne</hi> is beſt and moſt ſecurely eſtabliſhed: nothing unjuſt and violent is permanent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God</hi> overthrow the Devices of theſe Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,

                  <p>Some Obſervations I have already commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Divan,</hi> and to others of my Friends at the <hi>Sublime Port.</hi> All my Letters are made common to the <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Slaves of him who rules the World.</hi> Thou haſt heard of the Death of a Potent King, a Great Queen, and a Mighty Favourite: Now let us change the <hi>Scene,</hi> and paſs from the Melancholy <hi>Themes</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> the Unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Fate</hi> of <hi>Mortals,</hi> to the ſprightly Joys of Life, the blooming Years of an Infant King, who takes an early Leap from his <hi>Cradle</hi> to a <hi>Throne.</hi> Thou wilt not expect I ſhould ſpeak much of him, who as yet can ſay but little of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:102956:122"/>himſelf. However, in paſſing by this <hi>Little Great one,</hi> it would be ill Manners not to pay him a Salute or <hi>Congé</hi> who, though Young, ſeems no Novice in <hi>Punctilio's</hi> of <hi>Courtſhip,</hi> as appears by his Addreſs to the <hi>Biſhop</hi> who Baptized him; (if thou knoweſt not what that means, it is the <hi>firſt Ceremony</hi> whereby they are made <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and, it anſwers to our <hi>Circumciſion.</hi>) As ſoon as the <hi>Myſtery</hi> was performed, this Young Prince, with an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Countenance, and becoming Gravity, ſpoke thus to the <hi>Prelate: My</hi> Father, <hi>I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thank you, and ſhall be eternally obliged to you: My Parents gave me onely an Earthly Crown, but you have made me Heir of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There were preſent, the <hi>Queen,</hi> the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs</hi> of <hi>Conde, Cardinal Mazarini,</hi> with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Perſons of <hi>Quality.</hi> The whole Aſſembly were aſtoniſhed at the Child's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion (being but about Four Years of Age); taking it for an <hi>Omen</hi> of his Future Piety and extraordinary Actions.

And that he could not do the King a better Service, than by diſpoſing of theſe Preferments, to ſuch as would not onely thereby be obliged to Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty themſelves, but would alſo link the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies</hi> to which they belong, to the <hi>Royal</hi> Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt better comprehend the Policy of this <hi>Miniſter,</hi> in thus endeavouring to ſecure the <hi>Dignified Clergy,</hi> when thou weigheſt then Strength, and conſidereſt their Numbers.</p>
                  <p>There are in <hi>France</hi> 12 <hi>Archbiſhopricks,</hi> 104 <hi>Biſhopricks, Convents</hi> of the <hi>Greater Order</hi> 540, <hi>Convents</hi> of the <hi>Leſſer Order</hi> 12320, <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies</hi> 1450, <hi>Nunneries</hi> 67; 700 <hi>Frieries,</hi> 259 <hi>Seminaries</hi> of the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Knights</hi> of <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> 27400 <hi>Pariſh-Churches, Hospitals</hi> 540, Private <hi>Chappels</hi> or <hi>Oratories</hi> 9000.

                  </p>
                  <p>It has been uſual, to take an Eſtimate of the Glory and Riches of a <hi>Prince,</hi> from the Number of his People; but, I would not have thee think the <hi>French</hi> King the Wealthier,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:102956:123"/>for this Prodigious Number of <hi>Devotees;</hi> The greateſt part of which, he has more reaſon to look upon, as an Army of Enemies, than Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Indeed, the Intereſt of the <hi>Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Pariſh-Prieſts,</hi> is twiſted with that of the <hi>Crown;</hi> but, the <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Friars</hi> are the Creatures of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and all of them together are not maintained with leſs Coſt, than the Fourth Part of the <hi>Revenues</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> out of which in former Times, there went Yearly a Million of Crowns to the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cannot perceive, wherein conſiſts the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of cheriſhing ſo many Neſts of Spiritual Leeches, who ſuck the very Blood and Vitals of the Nation: One would think, it were ſufficiently dreined by the <hi>Royal</hi> Cuſtoms, Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and Impoſts.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Kings have Monopoliz'd all the Salt of the Kingdom into their own Hands, which they compel their Subjects to buy of them at their own Rates. To this End, they have Officers in all Parts, who vend it for them. It looks, as if they took care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Subjects from Corruption, and were afraid, leſt they ſhould putrefy alive; there being not a Man in all their Dominions, who is not obliged to take the Quantity which the Officers Impoſe on him, except in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Provinces, which for reaſons of State, or by Treaty, are exempted. The Revenue which ariſes to the King from this Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, amounts to near Three Millions of Crowns yearly. He hath Eight Millions more
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:102956:123"/>coming in by Subſidies, from the Peaſants; beſides many particular Impoſts on Fleſh, Wine and other Commodities. Yet, he loſes a conſiderable Part of his Revenues, by Farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them out to his Subjects, or Mortgaging them in Time of War for ready Money. He has no leſs than Thirty Thouſand Officers, that are wholly employed in collecting his Revenues, whoſe Penſions and Salaries leſſen the King's Income by above half; ſo that, out of Fourſcore Millions of Crowns, which are Yearly ſqueez'd from the People, ſcarce Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Millions come entire into the King's Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt wonder at the Improvidence of theſe <hi>Infidel</hi> Kings, and at the ſame time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn their Tyranny and Injuſtice, who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, plunder and ruine thoſe that furniſh them with all Neceſſaries for Humane Suſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, to enrich (not themſelves, but) a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of greedy Caterpillars; for, ſuch, and no better, are thoſe who gather their Revenues. It is not ſo in the <hi>Sacred Empire</hi> of the <hi>Oz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> where <hi>Juſtice</hi> has erected her <hi>Throne,</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> dares not ſhew her <hi>Face.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, the <hi>French</hi> ſeem born for Slavery, they bear it ſo patiently, without ever aſpiring after a Redemption. The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> exclaim againſt our <hi>Janizaries,</hi> accuſing them of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence, Oppreſſion, Rapine, and all the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to which a Licentious Soldiery are uſually addicted; but, theſe are Trifles, to what the <hi>French Dragoons</hi> commit, when quarter'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the poor Country-people: they Rob them
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:102956:124"/>of all they have, practiſing a Thouſand Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainies, to which the <hi>Janizaries</hi> are wholly Strangers; Adulteries paſs for Gallantry with them, and Rapes are counted but the Exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of an Immoderate Paſſion; the Husband muſt ſtand quietly, whilſt his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wife is in the Arms of a Domineering <hi>Hector;</hi> the Father muſt behold his Daughter deflowr'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcovering the leaſt Regret. Theſe are the Methods by which this People are morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and they ſeem to be ſtupid under their Calamities, not having Courage enough left to meditate a Redreſs, unleſs it be by becoming Soldiers themſelves; for, of ſuch as theſe, is the <hi>Infantry</hi> of <hi>France</hi> compoſed. Hence, it is not to be admired, that they are eſteemed the feebleſt, baſeſt and moſt deſpicable Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of any in <hi>Europe;</hi> ſince, not the purſuit of Honour, nor Love to their Country, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces them to take up Arms, but deſpair of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving otherwiſe, being reduced to the moſt rigorous Extremities on this ſide Famine.</p>
                  <p>Live thou in the Honour with which <hi>God</hi> and our <hi>Emperour</hi> have inveſted thee, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thy Vertue, which will raiſe thee yet Higher.

                  <p>THE <hi>French</hi> Kings ſteer their Courſe by other <hi>Maxims</hi> of Policy, than thoſe which are practis'd at the <hi>Sublime Port.</hi> It ſeems, they are not apprehenſive of any Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Deſigns in the <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Blood;</hi> ſince, they not onely allow them <hi>Liberty,</hi> but alſo load them with <hi>Honours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou haſt formerly heard me ſpeak of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the IV. this King's Grandfather, and of the paſſionate Love he bore to Ladies. Among the Reſt of his Miſtreſſes, none poſſeſs'd a larger ſhare of his Affections, than the <hi>Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs</hi> of <hi>Beaufort;</hi> by her he had two Sons, the Eldeſt is called <hi>Alexander,</hi> the other, <hi>Caeſar,</hi> They are both now Living, and enjoy Great Preferments; the Firſt, being made <hi>Grand Prior</hi> of the <hi>French Knights</hi> of <hi>Malta,</hi> which is a Dignity next to that of <hi>Maſter</hi> of the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> who commands the whole <hi>Iſland.</hi> It is obſervable, that this <hi>Alexander,</hi> during his Father's Life-Time, had attained no higher than to be made a <hi>Knight;</hi> but, as ſoon as his Brother <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. came to the <hi>Crown,</hi> he procured him the Honour he now has. The Second Brother alſo, is made Governour of <hi>Brettaigne,</hi> and married to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceur</hi>'s Daughter. By which means, he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one of the Richeſt <hi>Peers</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:102956:125"/>King <hi>Henry</hi> had alſo two other Sons, one of his own Name, whom he got on the <hi>Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of <hi>Verneville;</hi> He is now a <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Abbot,</hi> which are conſiderable <hi>Dignities</hi> in the <hi>Church.</hi> The other Son they call <hi>Antoine,</hi> whoſe Mother was the <hi>Counteſs</hi> of <hi>Morret.</hi> He alſo is inveſted with the like <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Honours as his Brother <hi>Henry.</hi> Theſe Four Brothers, though by the <hi>French</hi> eſteem'd as Baſtards (becauſe born of the Kings <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines</hi>) are nevertheleſs entruſted with the Offices and Preferments already mention'd, without any Jealouſie that they will be guilty of ſiniſter Practices to embroil the <hi>State,</hi> or gain the <hi>Crown.</hi> And, if I may ſpeak freely, there ſeems to be more of Humanity and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in this Courſe, than in that Cruel Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of our <hi>Sultans,</hi> who no ſooner aſcend the Throne, but all their Brethren are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately Sacrific'd to their Suſpicion and the Ends of <hi>State;</hi> or, if they chance to eſcape the <hi>Bow-String,</hi> are detain'd their whole Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in a cloſe Impriſonment, which is worſe than Death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. has alſo left another Brother behind him, born of the ſame Mother as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. They call him, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans;</hi> a Man of a daring Spirit, and great Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He is but newly come to the <hi>Court,</hi> having been baniſhed for ſome Enterpriſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Brother.</p>
                  <p>It was the Opinion of the <hi>French,</hi> that this <hi>Prince</hi> would have a ſhare in the <hi>Regency;</hi> but, <hi>Lewis</hi> would by no Means conſent to it,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:102956:125"/>to the Prejudice of his Queen, whom he left en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely poſſeſs'd of the <hi>Sovereign</hi> Power, till the Young King comes of Age. However, as yet, ſhe holds a ſeeming Correſpondence with the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde;</hi> by whoſe Mediations, ſeveral <hi>Grandees,</hi> who were Priſoners of <hi>State,</hi> are now releaſed, and make their Appearance at the <hi>Court.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From hence thou mayſt gather, that Things are not managed here with ſuch Rigour and Severity, as at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of our <hi>Invincible Emperours</hi> are impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and Execution ſwift.</p>
                  <p>There is a <hi>Biſhop</hi> to whom the <hi>Queen-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi> ſeems to be inclined. He has the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a very good Man, but they ſay, he is too ſimply Honeſt for a <hi>Courtier,</hi> and that <hi>Cardinal Mazarini</hi> will over-reach him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that <hi>Prelate</hi> has the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Ear at Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and his Creatures extol him for a Man of great Abilities. 'Tis ſaid, the <hi>Queen</hi> has writ to the <hi>Pope,</hi> deſiring a <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s Hat for him: And ſome whiſper, that he will be made the <hi>Prime Miniſter,</hi> in the Room of <hi>Mazarini.</hi> To ſpeak my Sentiment, I wiſh he were; for there ſeems not ſo much Reaſon to apprehend from his Counſels any notable Deſign againſt the <hi>Ottoman Port,</hi> as from thoſe of the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> whom I look upon as a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Richlieu.</hi> Here are ſeveral Intereſts on Foot; the whole <hi>Court</hi> is divided into Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſtriving to undermine and ſupplant each other.</p>
                  <p>It is not here as in <hi>Turkey,</hi> where the greateſt
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:102956:126"/>
                     <hi>Baſſa's</hi> are but the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Slaves. The <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> are equal to ſome <hi>Soveraign Kings;</hi> and upon the leaſt Grudge, will raiſe Armies, and give the King Battel, if he does not come to their Terms, and make a ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory Compoſition. Neither dares the King put any of them to Death, for fear of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who generally take their Part, being gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Novelties and prone to rebel.</p>
                  <p>Wouldſt thou know, by what Means the <hi>Nobility</hi> of <hi>France</hi> arrive to ſuch a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Power? I tell thee, in a Word, the Kings themſelves have put a Sword into their Hands, which they ſpare not to draw, when their Ambition or Diſcontent prompts them to it. They are freed from all Tribute and Homage; have the Command of whole <hi>Provinces</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them, in which are great Numbers of Walled Towns, Forts and Caſtles. Theſe great Charges, procure them the Eſteem and Veneration of the People living under their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; who honour them as Kings, and readily take up Arms in their Vindication.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Queen-Regent</hi> is fearful, leſt they ſhould take Advantage of her Son's Minority; and, under Pretence of Reforming the <hi>State,</hi> or ſerving the King's Intereſt, they ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve the Kingdom in <hi>Civil Wars.</hi> She keeps a ſtrict Watch over the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and, obſerves the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Motions: Her, Guards are doubled, and ſhe neglects nothing that may aſſure the Intereſts of the <hi>Crown.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou, who ſtandeſt by the <hi>Silent Fountain,</hi> and art near the Perſon of the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>
                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:102956:126"/>think of doing <hi>Mahmut</hi> ſome good Office, who loves cordially, ſerves faithfully, and prays ſervently for the Health and Long Life of our <hi>Glorious Sultan,</hi> and wiſhes thee thy Fill of Happineſs.</p>

                     <hi>To the</hi> Captain Baſſa.</head>
                  <p>HERE are arrived ſeveral Hundreds of <hi>Slaves,</hi> who have Manumitted themſelves by a Bold Adventure; an Exploit, which, to give them their due, has ſomething in it of Bravery. The Place of their <hi>Captivity,</hi> was <hi>Alexandria;</hi> thou knoweſt the Circumſtances of that <hi>Haven:</hi> What Hazards will not the deſire of Liberty put Men upon? There were ſeveral Thouſands of <hi>Franks</hi> in the City, whom the Reſtraint and Rigors of Servitude, had made weary of their Lives. Among the Reſt, a Native of <hi>Brabant,</hi> who having been bred up in the Art of diſtilling <hi>Strong Waters,</hi> his <hi>Patron</hi> hired him a Shop, furniſhing him with all Materials and Neceſſaries to proſecute his Calling, in hopes of very profitable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns. To this Man's Shop, there was a great Reſort of all the <hi>Franks</hi> in the City, by
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:102956:127"/>which Means he improv'd his Trade, and thriv'd mightily. He was a Bold Fellow, and took a particular Pride in great Attempts; and though he might have lived very happily, and enrich'd himſelf by his own Occupation, yet he had another ſort of <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> to practiſe; being reſolved, to draw his Fellow-Slaves, (who were now become his Cuſtomers) off from the Lees of Deſpair, and elevate them to a Reſolution of ſeeking their Freedom. He often harangu'd them on this Subject, and a ſtrict Intelligence was held between all the <hi>European</hi>-Slaves in that City. At length, it was agreed amongſt them, to ſeize a certain Veſſel, that lay in the Harbour, and commit themſelves to the Winds and Waves. This was carried on with ſo much ſecrecy, and ſo dextrous a Conduct, that unſuſpected, above two Thouſand of them got aboard, and put out to Sea. The Wind favouring them, they firſt arrived at <hi>Candia,</hi> where they Landed ſome Hundreds of their Crew; after this, they touch'd at <hi>Malta,</hi> where they diſpoſed of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; then, at <hi>Livorno</hi> in <hi>Italy;</hi> and laſtly, came ſafe to <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> where the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der came aſhore. Theſe are Natives of <hi>France, England, Brabant,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> with Two <hi>Spaniſh Prieſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Paris,</hi> are very Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to them, eſpecially the Merchants, who traffick in the <hi>Levant,</hi> of which there are great Numbers in this City. The <hi>Clergy</hi> alſo, have made a Collection for them; and, 'tis ſaid, the <hi>Queen-Regent</hi> has ordered her <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner,</hi>
                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:102956:127"/>to diſtribute three Thouſand Crowns among them.</p>
                  <p>They inveigh bitterly againſt the <hi>Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> curſing our <hi>Holy Prophet,</hi> and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their good Stars, for thus fortunately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming them from an <hi>Inſupportable Slavery.</hi> I cannot ſee, wherein they merit Blame in all this; it being Natural for all Men, to covet Liberty; and to rejoice when they have eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped any Misfortune. I proteſt, I cannot be angry with them in my Heart for any Thing, but the <hi>Blaſphemies</hi> they vomit againſt the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> The reſt, are Actions as Natural, as to Eat and Drink. <hi>Self-Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> being common to all Animals, there ſeems as much Reaſon to condemn a Bird that chirps and triumphs, when ſhe fee's her ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Wing, ranging the Balmy Air, being newly releaſed from the Cage; as, to find fault with theſe Fellows, for rejoicing that they have eſcaped the Confinement and Hardſhips of <hi>Captivity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, it was an unpardonable Neglect of the Guards who belong to that City, to ſuffer theſe <hi>Infidels</hi> thus to give them the ſlip. So culpable a Remiſſneſs, may coſt ſome of them their Heads.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Great God,</hi> whoſe Power is manifeſted in the <hi>Ocean</hi> as well as on the <hi>dry Land,</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh thee with as favourable Winds as theſe <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitives</hi> had, when thou ſaileſt to execute the <hi>Orders</hi> of the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi>

                  <p>THIS <hi>Court</hi> has within theſe Three Days put on another Face, than it had ever ſince the <hi>Royal Obſequies</hi> were perform'd. One would hardly think it the ſame, were it not for the <hi>Mourning</hi> they ſtill wear, on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the late <hi>King</hi>'s Death. This is a Formality uſed all over <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> in ſuch Caſes, and ſerves for a <hi>Diſguiſe</hi> to <hi>Hypocrites.</hi> The <hi>French Grandees,</hi> make uſe of it to maſque their ſeveral <hi>Politick</hi> Deſigns. They wear <hi>Black,</hi> the <hi>Emblem</hi> of <hi>Sadneſs,</hi> to denote their <hi>Grief</hi> for the <hi>Dead Monarch,</hi> and yet they feaſt and revel, to the end they may ſend more of the <hi>Royal Blood</hi> after him. The Matter I am going to inform thee of, is <hi>Tragical</hi> in it ſelf; and had been worſe, but for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of <hi>Providence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Three Days ago, the <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Blood,</hi> with divers of the <hi>Prime Nobility,</hi> were invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a Feaſt by the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Order. The Place where 'twas kept, is called the <hi>New-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.</hi> It is needleſs for me to deſcribe the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Entertainment; thou mayſt conclude, all Things were performed with Great Coſt and Majeſty. They Banquetted with Wine to Exceſs; inſomuch, as the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi> about Midnight, walking through a Gallery, was ſo inebriated with the Juice of the Grape,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:102956:128"/>that he fell aſleep on a Couch, which ſtood about the middle of the Walk; he was wrapt in his Cloak, a Garment well known in the <hi>Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> by the large Diamond that button'd it before; but no Body came by that way, till two Hours afterwards, a certain <hi>French Lord</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to his Lodging, took Notice of a Man aſleep on the Couch, and drawing nearer knew it to be the <hi>Duke.</hi> Wondering what ſhould be the meaning of it, he inquired of the <hi>Duke</hi>'s <hi>Page,</hi> that ſtood not far off, who told him, <hi>His Maſter was overcome with Wine.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> not thinking it convenient to leave a <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>Blood,</hi> in ſuch a Place at that Time of the Night, cauſed his Servants to take him up and carry him to his own Lodgings, who for the greater Conveniency, left his Cloak behind upon the Couch. As ſoon as they were gone, the <hi>Duke</hi>'s <hi>Page</hi> puts on the Cloak, and being alſo tyred with watching, laid himſelf down to ſleep. The <hi>Duke</hi> not long after awakes, and call'd for his <hi>Page,</hi> not knowing where he was. The Servants of the <hi>French Lord,</hi> immediately ran to the <hi>Page,</hi> but found him dead upon the Couch, being ſtabb'd through the Heart. Thou mayſt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what a Surprize the whole <hi>Court</hi> was in, when this Accident was known. Next Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſtrict Inquiſition was made into this Affair, but nothing brought to light; onely 'twas obſerv'd, that about Three a Clock in the Morning, an unknown Perſon was ſeen by the <hi>Centinels,</hi> to be let into <hi>Cardinal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarini</hi>'s Apartment. The Buſineſs is huſh'd
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:102956:129"/>up; yet people ſpare not to whiſper, that the <hi>Cardinal</hi> was privy to the Murder; adding, that the Blow was given by Miſtake, the <hi>Page</hi> being ſuppoſed to be the <hi>Duke,</hi> as he lay wrapt up in that Remarkable Cloak. It is common in theſe <hi>Infidel</hi> Countries, for great Men to hire Ruffians to execute their Revenge. And theſe Fellows are as prompt and dextrous at a private Murder, as our <hi>Mutes</hi> are to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Pleaſure of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> when he commands them to ſtrangle any Offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Baſſa.</hi> But they will have half the Price of their Villainy before-hand, and the Reſidue when 'tis accompliſh'd. Thus is innocent Blood become a Merchandice: They Traffick for Aſſaſſinations; and, a Man cannot call his Life his own, ſince at that very Inſtant, it may be bought by another. I have not heard that ſuch a deteſtable Wickedneſs has ever been practis'd in the <hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> much leſs in the <hi>Seraglio's</hi> of our <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> which are the Manſions of Juſtice and Vertue.</p>
                  <p>One of the <hi>Grandees</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> (whom they call the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Beaufort</hi>) takes inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Pains to find out the Author of this Murder. He is a mortal Enemy of <hi>Cardinal Mazarini,</hi> and would give half the Revenue of his Dukedom, could he remove him out of the Kingdom. He inſinuates very plauſible ſuſpicions into the Minds of the <hi>Courtiers,</hi> to render him odious. He dares not openly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him of being Acceſſary to the <hi>Page</hi>'s Death, having no Evident Proofs againſt him,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:102956:129"/>but he endeavours to create in all Men a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that he had a hand in it. He has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted a <hi>Magician,</hi> who has ſhew'd him the Figure of the Murderer in a Glaſs, and by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Effect of his Enchantments, has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him with a Picture drawn from the <hi>Magical</hi> Portraiture in the Glaſs, which the <hi>Duke</hi> has cauſed to be imitated by the Skilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt Maſters in <hi>France,</hi> ſending the Copies in great Numbers to all Parts of the Kingdom, with Orders to the Governours of Towns and Cities, eſpecially ſuch as are on the Frontiers and Sea-Coaſts, to cauſe all Travellers to be brought before them, and confronted with the Picture; that ſo (if poſſible) the Murderer may be diſcover'd, who will not fail to be put to all the Tortures they can invent, to draw a Confeſſion from him, <hi>That</hi> Cardinal Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini <hi>had contrived the Murder of the</hi> Duke <hi>of</hi> Orleans, <hi>though by Miſtake 'twas executed on his Page.</hi> But the <hi>Cardinal</hi> is even with him, having accuſed him to the <hi>Queen,</hi> of deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Murder him; whereupon, the <hi>Duke</hi> is ſent Priſoner to the <hi>Caſtle</hi> of the <hi>Wood</hi> of <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciennes.</hi> This makes the Creatures of <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> to murmur and ſay, There is a higher Hand than the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s alone, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of this Murder. Libels are ſcatter'd up and down the Streets, and 'tis ſaid, that the <hi>Ghoſt</hi> of the <hi>Page</hi> has been often ſeen to walk in the Royal Apartments.</p>
                  <p>In the mean Time, I wait all Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to do the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> ſome effectual Service, ſnatching every Contingency which
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:102956:130"/>many advance the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Intereſt. Neither am I forgetful, to oblige my Friends.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Great God,</hi> preſerve thee from untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Death, and give thee Favour with the <hi>Sultan.</hi>

                     <hi>To</hi> Peſtelihali, <hi>his Brother.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>WHEN I wrote laſt to thee, I thought I ſhould have taken a farther Journey than thou: <hi>Aſia</hi> was the deſigned Stage of thy <hi>Travels;</hi> but I look'd on my ſelf at that time, as bound for another World: And therefore, having no hopes of ever ſeeing thee again in this, I gave thee a ſolemn Adieu. It is now Four Years ſince that Letter was writ, during which, thou haſt ſeen many ſtrange Things in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> while I have obſerv'd ſome Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables in the <hi>Weſt.</hi> Thou art return'd ſafe to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and I am ſtill alive in <hi>Paris.</hi> I am overjoy'd to hear I have a Brother living; I hope thou wilt not be ſorry, that I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto eſcaped the Stroke of Death. We two, are the onely ſurviving of all our Race; let us love one another, as though there were No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in the World for us to love. As for our Mother, I know not whether ſhe be on Earth or in <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> The laſt Letter ſhe ſent me, expreſs'd her Grief for the Death of her
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:102956:130"/>ſecond Husband, ſince which, Eighteen <hi>Moons</hi> are elaps'd, and I have heard Nothing of her. I deſire thee, if thou haſt any Tenderneſs for <hi>Mahmut,</hi> to ſatisfie me whether ſhe be living or dead? Perhaps ſhe is married again, and may be removed into ſome unknown Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. I am perplex'd with a Thouſand Anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties about her.</p>
                  <p>Remember, That the <hi>Tribe</hi> to which we belong, was none of the moſt Obſcure in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia.</hi> Let us imitate the <hi>Virtues</hi> of our <hi>Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi> without medling with their <hi>Vices;</hi> In ſuch a <hi>Family,</hi> it will not be difficult to find ſome good Examples, and ſuch as are worthy to be follow'd. Let us learn Temperance from One, Prudence from Another, Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity from a Third, and the Rules of Piety and Juſtice from them All. This I take to be a proper Method to acquire an Excellency in Vertue, and to root good Habits in us; it being certain, that Practical Examples have more Influence on Men, than the moſt pithy and ſage Inſtructions. Who can reflect on the Incomparable Modeſty of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeph,</hi> my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Brother, and not to be charm'd; Thou mayſt remember, with how ſweet a Grace of Mildneſs and Condeſcention, all his Actions were adorn'd. He was eſteem'd the moſt Polite Man in thoſe Parts. From him we may learn, to bear Injuries patiently, and not to grow pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh at the Impertinences of the Vulgar; not to be of a rugged Temper, Fierce or Revengeful, but to be always of an even Deportment, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing all Men with Civilities and good Offices;
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:102956:131"/>the very Nature of which, brings its own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward along with it (if there were no other) the Mind being fed with an inexpreſſible Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, after ſuch Generous Performances.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mehmet Ali,</hi> our Kinſman, was a Man of ſingular Government and Moderation. He was neither vainly fond of his Friend, nor Humorous or Cold. He rejected Flatterers, and was not concern'd at Slanderers. He was neither Superſtitious, nor Prophane; Liberal without Pride, Frugal without Avarice, and in all Things he carried himſelf with exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Sobriety and Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Such Men as theſe, we ought to ſet before us, as Patterns of a good Life; and, in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their Steps, we ſhall honour the <hi>Family</hi> from which we deſcend.</p>
                  <p>In peruſing thy Letter, I find thou haſt made ſome profitable Remarks in thy <hi>Travels.</hi> Thou haſt been at the <hi>Courts</hi> of ſeveral Great and Illuſtrious <hi>Princes,</hi> and returneſt Home en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd with a Treaſury of Jewels, of a far high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Price than Rubies and Diamonds. The Knowledge which thou haſt purchaſed, is a Merchandice for Kings, and will render thee acceptable to the Sovereigns of the Earth. Thou haſt improv'd much in a little Time, and ſhalt reap the Honour and Profit of thy Experience all the Days of thy Life.</p>
                  <p>It will be a kind Office, if thou wilt gratify thy Brother with ſome of thoſe choice Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations thou haſt made. I have a particular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, to be inform'd of many Things in the <hi>Indies.</hi> Our Couſin <hi>Iſouf,</hi> is covetous of his
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:102956:131"/>
                     <hi>Memoirs;</hi> he will not impart any thing to me, though he has likewiſe travers'd all the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> I would fain know the Age and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the preſent <hi>Mogol.</hi> Here is a <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueze</hi> in the City, with whom I ſometimes converſe. He has been at <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> and ſays, That the preſent <hi>Emperour</hi> of that Country, is a Man of no great Abilities, ſuffering his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs to be managed by the Conduct of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; That he has more than ordinary Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with one of his Daughters; That he has Four Sons, whom he has made <hi>Sovereigns</hi> of <hi>Provinces:</hi> They are Princes of Active Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; and, he ſays, 'tis fear'd, they will one Day depoſe their Father.</p>
                  <p>He tells a Remarkable Story of the <hi>Grand Mogol</hi>'s being once in Danger of his Life; which, becauſe it has ſomething in it very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, I will in Brief relate it to thee.</p>
                  <p>It happened, that this <hi>Prince</hi> was riding on one of his <hi>Elephants</hi> in the <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Caſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,</hi> when ſuddenly the Beaſt grew raging mad; (it ſeems it is the Nature of theſe Animals. when they are ſtung with Luſt, at certain times of the Year, to fall into a kind of Phrenzy, which, if not timely obviated, will laſt Fourty Days.) He, whoſe Office it was to manage the <hi>Elephant,</hi> perceiving that the King's Life was in apparent Danger, through the Furious Humour of the Beaſt, had not time to ſay any more to the King, but only theſe Words; <hi>There is but this onely way to ſave your Life, that I ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice mine to the</hi> Elephant, <hi>which I freely do, as an unfeigned Teſtimony of my Loyalty,</hi> With
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:102956:132"/>that he caſt himſelf at the <hi>Elephant</hi>'s Feet, which immediately took him up with his Trunk and kill'd him, and ſo became pacified. The King aſtoniſhed at ſo ſurprizing an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, and to teſtifie his Gratitude for ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallell'd a Fidelity, ſent for this Man's Sons, and having ask'd them, whether they could have Reſolution enough to follow their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Example in ſuch a Caſe, to which they all anſwering, <hi>That his</hi> Majeſty <hi>might ſee it immediately, if he pleas'd to give but the Word;</hi> the King caus'd Rich Veſts to be beſtowed on every one of them, with other Preſents, and made them the <hi>Chief Maſters</hi> of his <hi>Elephants,</hi> throughout the <hi>Empire.</hi> The <hi>Portugueze</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That in token of Thankfulneſs to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for ſo ſignal a Preſervation, the <hi>Emperor</hi> gave Royal and Munificent Alms to all the Poor in that <hi>Province,</hi> vowing, never to ride again on an <hi>Elephant,</hi> ſince it had coſt him the Life of one of his moſt Faithful Servants.</p>
                  <p>If thou haſt met with any Inſtances of ſo Remarkable a Vertue, Inſert them in thy Letter; for, whatever may be in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> a Man may live whole Ages, in theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts, before he ſhall find ſuch unſhaken Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity in a Servant. The <hi>King Eternal</hi> caſt an Eye of favour on thee, and reward thee for the Love thou beareſt to our Glorious <hi>Sultan.</hi>

                  <p>HERE is a Man come to this City, if he may be called a Man, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to have lived above theſe Sixteen Hundred Years. They call him the <hi>Wandring Jew.</hi> But ſome ſay, he is an <hi>Impoſtor.</hi> He ſays of himſelf, that he was <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (the <hi>Jews</hi> call it the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Judgment</hi>) where all <hi>Criminal Cauſes</hi> were
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:102956:133"/>tryed, at the Time when <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> the <hi>Chriſtians Meſſias,</hi> was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> the <hi>Roman Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</hi> That his Name was <hi>Michob Ader;</hi> and that, for thruſting <hi>Jeſus</hi> out of the <hi>Hall</hi> with theſe words, <hi>Go, why tarrieſt thou?</hi> The <hi>Meſſias</hi> anſwered him again; <hi>I go, but tarry thou till I come;</hi> thereby condemning him, to live till the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Judgment.</hi> He pretends to remember the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> that lived in thoſe Days, and that he himſelf was <hi>Baptized</hi> by one of them; that he has travelled through all the <hi>Regions</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and ſo muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be a Vagabond till the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhall return again. They ſay, that he heals Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, by touching the Party affected. Divers other <hi>Miracles,</hi> are aſcribed to him by the <hi>Ignorant</hi> and <hi>Superſtitious.</hi> But the <hi>Learned,</hi> the <hi>Noble,</hi> and the <hi>Great,</hi> cenſure him as a Counterfeit or a Madman. Yet there are, who affirm, that 'tis one convincing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Reality of his Pretence, that he has hitherto eſcaped a Priſon, eſpecially in theſe Countries, where the Authors of all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations are ſeverely puniſhed. He has e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped the <hi>Inquiſitions</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and in <hi>Portugal,</hi> which the Vulgar will have to be an evident <hi>Miracle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One Day I had the Curioſity to Diſcourſe with him in ſeveral Languages; and, I found him Maſter of all thoſe that I could ſpeak. I converſed with him Five or Six Hours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Arabick.</hi> He told me, that there was ſcarce a true Hiſtory to be found. I asked
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:102956:133"/>him, what he thought of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> and <hi>Lawgiver</hi> of the <hi>Muſſulmans?</hi> He anſwered, That he knew his Father very well, and had been often in his Company at <hi>Ormus</hi> in <hi>Perſia;</hi> That <hi>Mahomet,</hi> was a Man full of Light and a Divine Spirit, but had his Errors as well as other Mortals, and that his chiefeſt was, in denying the <hi>Crucifixion</hi> of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> for, ſaid he, <hi>I was then preſent, and ſaw him hang on the</hi> Croſs <hi>with theſe Eyes of mine.</hi> He accus'd the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> of <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,</hi> in making the World believe, That the <hi>Tomb</hi> of their <hi>Prophet,</hi> hangs miraculouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Heaven and Earth, ſaying, That he himſelf had ſeen it, and that it was built after the manner of other Sepulchres. Thou who haſt been at the <hi>Holy Place,</hi> knoweſt whether this be true or falſe. He upbraids the <hi>Perſian Mahometans,</hi> with <hi>Luxury;</hi> the <hi>Ottomans</hi> with <hi>Tyranny,</hi> the <hi>Arabians</hi> with <hi>Robbery,</hi> the <hi>Moors</hi> with <hi>Cruelty,</hi> and the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> of the <hi>Indies</hi> with <hi>Atheiſm:</hi> Nor does he ſpare to reproach the <hi>Chriſtian Churches:</hi> He taxes the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Grecian</hi> with the <hi>Pompous I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry</hi> of the <hi>Heathens.</hi> He accuſes the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopian</hi> of <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> the <hi>Armenian</hi> of <hi>Hereſie;</hi> and ſays, that the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> if they would live according to their Profeſſion, would be the beſt <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He told me, he was in <hi>Rome,</hi> when <hi>Nero</hi> ſet Fire to the City, and ſtood triumphing on the Top of a Hill to behold its Flames. That he ſaw <hi>Saladine</hi>'s Return from his Conqueſts in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> when he caus'd his Shirt to be
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:102956:134"/>carried on the Top of a Spear, with this Proclamation, <hi>Saladine,</hi> Lord <hi>of many rich Countries, Conquerour of the</hi> Eaſt, <hi>ever Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious and happy, when he dies ſhall have no other Memorial left of all his Glories, but only this poor Shirt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He relates many remarkable Paſſages of <hi>Solyman the Magnificent,</hi> whereof our Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are ſilent, and ſays, he was in <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> when <hi>Solyman</hi> built that <hi>Royal Moſque,</hi> which goes by his Name. He knew <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain</hi> the <hi>Scythian,</hi> and told me, that he was ſo call'd, becauſe he halted with one Leg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He pretends alſo to have been acquainted with <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> the Valiant and Fortunate <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Epirus.</hi> He ſeem'd to pity the inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable Calamity of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> whom he had ſeen carried about in a <hi>Cage</hi> by <hi>Tamerlain</hi>'s Order. He accuſes the <hi>Scythian,</hi> of too Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous an Inſult on the Unfortunate <hi>Sultan.</hi> He remembers the Antient <hi>Caliphs</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Aegypt;</hi> the <hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>Sarazens!</hi> and, the <hi>Wars</hi> in the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> He highly extols the Valour and Conduct of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bulloigne.</hi> He gives an accurate Account of the Riſe, Progreſs, Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, and Subverſion of the <hi>Mamalukes</hi> in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> He ſays, he has waſhed himſelf in the Two Head-ſprings of the River <hi>Nile,</hi> which ariſe in the moſt <hi>Southern</hi> Part of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia.</hi> That its Encreaſe is occaſion'd by the great Rains in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> which ſwell all the Rivers that fall into the <hi>Nile,</hi> and cauſe that vaſt <hi>Inundation,</hi> which has ſo much
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:102956:134"/>puzzled <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> to find out the Origin. He ſays, that the River <hi>Ganges</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> is broader and deeper than the <hi>Nile,</hi> that the River <hi>Niger</hi> in <hi>Africa</hi> is longer by ſome Hundreds of Miles. And, that he can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a time, when the River <hi>Nile</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed not till Three Months after the uſual Seaſon.</p>
                  <p>Having profeſſed himſelf an Univerſal Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, and that there was no Corner of the Earth, where he had not been preſent: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to comfort my ſelf with the hopes of ſome News from the <hi>Ten Tribes</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that were carried into Captivity by <hi>Salma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſar</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and could never be heard of ſince. I asked him ſeveral Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning them, but found no ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory Anſwer. Only he told me, that both in <hi>Aſia, Africk,</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> he had taken Notice of a Sort of People, who (though not <hi>Jews</hi> in Profeſſion) yet retained ſome <hi>Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteriſticks,</hi> whereby one might diſcover them to be deſcended of that Nation.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Livonia, Ruſſia,</hi> and <hi>Finland,</hi> he had met with People of diſtinct Languages from that of the Country, having a great mixture of <hi>Hebrew</hi> Words; that theſe abſtained from Swines Fleſh, Blood, and Things ſtrangled. That in their Lamentations for the Dead, they always us'd theſe Words <hi>[Jeru-Jeru Maſco Salem.]</hi> By which he thought, they called to Remembrance <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus,</hi> thoſe two Famous Cities of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> and <hi>Syria.</hi> In the <hi>Circaſſians</hi> alſo, he had
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:102956:135"/>traced ſome Footſteps of <hi>Judaiſm;</hi> their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, Manner of Life, Feaſts, Marriages, and Sacrifices, being not far removed from the Inſtitutions of the <hi>Moſaick Law.</hi> But what is moſt remarkable, he ſaid, that he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with profeſſed <hi>Jews</hi> in the <hi>North</hi> Parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> who never ſo much as heard of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> or of the Revolutions in <hi>Judea</hi> after his Death, the Siege and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or any other Matters wherewith all Hiſtories abound concerning that Nation. He ſaid moreover, that theſe <hi>Jews</hi> had only the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> not having heard of the reſt of thoſe Books which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the greateſt Part of the <hi>Old Teſtament;</hi> and, that this <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> was written in a ſort of <hi>Hebrew,</hi> far different from that which is now commonly ſpoken, by the reſt of the diſperſed <hi>Jews</hi> throughout the World. That the number of theſe <hi>Jews</hi> was Infinite. And finally, he thought, that theſe (if any) were the true Poſterity of thoſe <hi>Ten Captive Tribes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having mentioned the Deſtruction of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> I ask'd him where he was at that time?

                  <p>I tell thee, he ſeems to be a Man well vers'd in all Hiſtories, a Great Traveller, and one that affects to be counted an Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Perſon.

                  <p>JEalouſie, the Bane of Publick Alliances, as well as of Private Friendſhips, has car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Arms of <hi>Suedeland</hi> into <hi>Denmark,</hi> at a Time when leaſt expected.</p>
                  <p>All <hi>Europe</hi> was alarmed at the News of this <hi>Surprizing Invaſion;</hi> it being thought, that the <hi>Suedes</hi> had Work enough cut out for them in <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, few could penetrate into the Reaſons which induced them to reſpite the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts,</hi> and at the ſame Time carry the War into the Dominions of King <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> who, by his Mediation, and other good Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices between the <hi>German Emperour</hi> and that Crown, merited another kind of Return, than an <hi>Hoſtile Invaſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Peace-maker has moſt Times a thankleſs Office. I have ſeen a Gentleman, endeavouring to part or pacify Two of his Friends, encountring in the Streets of <hi>Paris,</hi>
                     <pb n="237" facs="tcp:102956:136"/>and has received the Point of one of the Rapiers in his Heart for his Kindneſs. So fared it with the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who was accepted of by both Parties, as Umpire of the Quarrel; and had ſent his <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> to <hi>Munſter,</hi> where he treated ſo ſucceſsfully with the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> that he brought them to Terms very advantageous to the <hi>Suedes;</hi> yet, the firſt Overtures of his Mediation, gave ſo great a ſuſpicion to that Nation, that while the <hi>Daniſh Ambaſſador</hi> was actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding a Peace for them, they commence a War, or rather tranſlate it from the <hi>Provinces</hi> of the <hi>Empire</hi> to <hi>Scania,</hi> entring that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with Twelve Thouſand Men; And, to ſhew the World they were in Earneſt, they pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately treat with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> to aſſiſt them with a <hi>Fleet</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> which was granted them under the Command of <hi>Admiral Martin Tyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the ſame Time, <hi>General Torſtenſon</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <hi>Holſtein,</hi> where he advanced with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Succeſs; took <hi>Kiel</hi> by ſurprize; and, paſſing forward, poſſeſſed himſelf of <hi>Jutland,</hi> driving King <hi>Chriſtian</hi> into a Corner of his Dominions; for, now he had only <hi>Zealand</hi> and <hi>Fionia</hi> left, which are Two <hi>Iſlands;</hi> the former whereof, commands the Paſſage into the <hi>Baltick Sea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> finds himſelf beſet with Difficulties and Dangers, by Sea and Land; yet, in regard his greateſt Strength lay in his Shipping, he wholly applies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to rig and man out a good <hi>Fleet.</hi> At
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:102956:137"/>the ſame Time, he informs his <hi>Allies</hi> of this Unjuſt War, and made paſſionate Complaints to the <hi>Emperour,</hi> for whoſe Sake all this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell him, imploring his Friendſhip and Aid in ſo great a Calamity. The <hi>Emperor</hi> ſends <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſo</hi> with Forces, who entring the Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Hamburgh</hi> and <hi>Lubeck,</hi> a <hi>League</hi> was Negotiated between the <hi>Emperour</hi> and the <hi>Daniſh</hi> King. But by the Artifices of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Holland Ambaſſadors</hi> at <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> the King was diſſwaded from making an Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Auſtria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, the <hi>Dunkirkers</hi> offered King <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> to maintain a Conſiderable <hi>Fleet</hi> in the <hi>Sound,</hi> at their own Charge, which he ſeemed to accept of.</p>

                     <hi>To</hi> Cara Haly, <hi>the</hi> Phyſician <hi>at</hi> Conſtantinople.</head>
                  <p>THOU haſt ſeen many in the Arms of Death, wraſtling with the <hi>Grim Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch</hi> of <hi>Shadows,</hi> who by the Privilege of an excellent Conſtitution, have diſengaged themſelves from his Clutches, and ſtood at open Defiance with him for ſome Years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. But I queſtion, whether thou haſt ever known any, whom that Conquerour has once laid in the Duſt, that recover'd again.</p>
                  <p>In a Village about half a League from this City, there died a Man (or at leaſt he ſeem'd to die) about a Week ago. He was ſtretch'd forth into the Poſture fitteſt for his Coffin, by the Hands of two old Women. His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Friends, flock'd about the Body, to pray for his Soul, as is the Cuſtom of the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> The Houſe was fill'd with Tears and Sighs, and a mournful Cloud ſat on every Brow. He lay thus for the ſpace of Thirty five Hours, Dead in the Suppoſition of all his Family. When the Watchers who ſate by, were ſuddenly aſtoniſhed to hear him ſneeze; they ran away at firſt, as People affrighted at ſome Ghaſtly Viſion, and alarm'd the whole Neighbourhood with the News. <hi>Phyſicians</hi> were ſent for, who cauſing him to be laid in
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:102956:138"/>a Warm Bed, and uſing proper Applications, he recover'd his Senſes, and by Degrees his Speech: they are in Hopes to reſtore him to perfect Health again. He relates to his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitants, many ſtrange Things, that he has ſeen and heard during the Five and Thirty Hours that he was thought to be Dead. He ſays, he has been before the <hi>Throne</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and has ſeen all the <hi>Orders</hi> of <hi>Angels;</hi> that he was commanded to return back again to his Body, to warn Men of the approaching <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> He preaches Repentance and good Works, to all that come near him. Hence it is, that the devouter ſort of People, reſort to his Houſe in <hi>Pilgrimage,</hi> eſteeming him a <hi>Saint.</hi> They ſay, he has anticipated the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Reſurrection,</hi> to give a freſh proof of it to this unbelieving Age, and to evince, that it will come to paſs before he ſhall quit his Body. He Prophecies, the Converſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> to be near at Hand, and, that the <hi>Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> ſhall embrace the <hi>Chriſtian Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such as are fond of Novelties, and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly inclined, believe what he ſays, to be as true as the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> but, the <hi>Learned</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it all to the Fumes of Melancholy, to which he was always naturally prone. For my Part, who believe that <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> was the laſt, and <hi>Seal</hi> of all the <hi>Prophets,</hi> look for none after him; nor am I credulous of every one, who pretends to a. <hi>Divine</hi> Commiſſion. Yet, when I am in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with ſuch as are this Man's Admirers, I talk as they do, and ſeem what I am not, that
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:102956:138"/>I may the better acquit my ſelf what I really am. Beſides, it is not Prudence, to provoke the Fury of Bigots, by oppoſing their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>They relate a Story, of a Man who died in this City, ſome Hundreds of Years ago; and, 'tis upon Record, That this Perſon during his Life Time, was eſteemed a <hi>very Holy Man,</hi> but after his Death, while they were perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Funeral Obſequies, and carrying the Body round the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Proceſſion,</hi> he ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſtarted up from the Bier on which he was carried, pronouncing theſe Words with an Audible Voice, <hi>I am arraigned before the Judgment Seat of</hi> God. All that heard him ſpeak, were aſtoniſhed at ſo ſurprizing an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and the <hi>Prieſts</hi> who ſang the <hi>Hymn</hi> of <hi>Reſt</hi> to his <hi>Soul,</hi> for a while deſiſted. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain going on with their Proceſſion and Hymns, he aroſe the Second Time, and ſaid aloud, <hi>I am tryed at</hi> God<hi>'s Tribunal.</hi> This put another ſtop to the Solemnity, till after ſome Deliberations, they reſolved to proceed a Third Time, when he ſtarted up again, and ſaid, <hi>I am condemned by the juſt Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of</hi> God. This put a final Stop to the Funeral Ceremonies. They would no longer chant a <hi>Reſt,</hi> to the <hi>Soul</hi> of him, whoſe dead <hi>Body</hi> aroſe, and pronounced him <hi>Damned.</hi> Neither would they bury his <hi>Body</hi> in <hi>Conſecrated</hi> Ground, whoſe <hi>Soul</hi> they knew was lodg'd in <hi>Hell,</hi> by a Voice from the Dead. There is an <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes,</hi> called <hi>Carthuſians,</hi> who, they ſay,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:102956:139"/>are a ſtanding Monument of the Truth of this Relation. For, one <hi>Bruno,</hi> being touch'd with Compunction, at ſo tremendous an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, immediately forſook the Society of Men, and led a Contemplative Life in exquiſite Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, Abſtinence, Faſting and Prayer, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning all his Followers to do the like. Who are now ſpread into moſt Parts of <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> having Magnificent Monaſteries, Great Immunities, and are eſteem'd the <hi>ſtricteſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> They are ſerved in the Markets before the King himſelf. If any <hi>Derviſe</hi> of another <hi>Order</hi> deſires to come into this, he may; but from this there is no Return. They dig a part of their own Graves every Day, having every one a Cell and a Garden to himſelf. They converſe with one another but once a Week. And if when they are walking in the <hi>Cloyſters</hi> of their <hi>Monaſtery,</hi> they happen to ſpy a Stranger, they ſcud a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way into their Cells, as Conies into their Holes, at the ſight of a Dog. They never taſte of Fleſh, and are obliged to pray Eight Hours in Four and Twenty.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Order</hi> has afforded Eminent Scholars and Stateſmen; but now 'tis like to have Men of another Character for its Proſelytes; for, ſince the Reſurrection of this <hi>new Prophet,</hi> I mentioned in the beginning of my Letter, the Rabble are all turning <hi>Carthuſians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou who art acquainted with the Nature of <hi>Ecſtaſies</hi> and <hi>Trances,</hi> wilt know what to judge of this Man's Raptures. The great <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> could fall into them when he pleaſed;
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:102956:139"/>and I have heard of a Learned <hi>Mahometan Derviſe</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> that had the Art of with-drawing his Soul from the Body, at which times he beheld <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Celeſtial</hi> Things, not by way of <hi>Contemplation,</hi> but real <hi>Intuition.</hi> We muſt acknowledge theſe to be the Favourites of <hi>Heaven,</hi> Friends of <hi>Nature,</hi> and privy to the Secrets of <hi>both Worlds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I deſire thee, to write me ſome News of my Friends; for, I can hear nothing from them. Which makes me think my ſelf among the Dead, and quite forgotten. If thou ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineſt thy wonted Chearfulneſs, thou art hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. Sadneſs is the Bane of the Soul, from which, I pray <hi>Heavens,</hi> preſerve both thee and me.</p>

                  <p>I Am a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> as well as thou, and yet I cannot find a Reaſon to live after thy Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Not, that I reprehend thy Choice, but I conſult my own Happineſs. I could wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly embrace a <hi>Monaſtick</hi> Life, were it not for the <hi>Vow</hi> of <hi>Obedience.</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Chaſtity</hi> and <hi>Poverty,</hi> are not ſo frightful. But, to be abſolutely reſigned to the Will of a <hi>Superiour</hi> (who may be a Thouſand Times more Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than my ſelf) is far more irkſome, than to be a <hi>Slave</hi> in <hi>Turky.</hi> There, a Man may pave himſelf a Way to many Enjoyments in the midſt of Captivity, and ſweeten his worſt Condition, with the Hopes of Freedom one Time or other. But here I muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to an everlaſting Servitude, and ſuch an one, as renders it a Crime, ſo much as to think of Pleaſure, or dream of a Releaſe. I muſt be for ever confin'd, to obey one that perhaps is not Maſter of himſelf; to humour all his Caprices; to give the Lye to that Sence and Reaſon, with which <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> have endued me: to make Black and White, Good and Evil, Reciprocal Terms; though every one knows, they are perfect Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions. In fine, I muſt reſolve in all Things,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:102956:140"/>(not excepting my very Thoughts) to be conducted by him, who for ought I know, follows no other Guide but his own Irregular Paſſions. What will then become of me, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch an unreaſonable Forfeiture of my Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Liberty? I will tell thee in one Word; from a Rational Creature, I ſhall be changed to a Brute; from a Man to a Sot; and, having now ſome Sparks of Vertue, I ſhall then be made the Rendezvous of all Vice.</p>
                  <p>Think not, that I go about to make thee hate the Manner of Life thou haſt choſen: Though I eſteem thee miſerable, do not judge ſo of thy ſelf. Thou mayſt find, a great deal of Pleaſure in that Reſtraint, which to me would be the moſt Inſupportable Calamity in the World: And, it may be as eaſie for thee, to ſubmit to the Will of another, as 'tis hard for me to comply with my Own. I am of ſo wavering a Conſtitution, that I cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great Difficulty pleaſe my ſelf, much leſs could I be able to humour the Extravagancies, of a Soul different from Mine. I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that ſhould I follow the Motions of my own proper Inclination at all Times, I ſhould do many Things whereof I might afterwards repent: why may not the Caſe be the ſame, or worſe, if I blindly obey the Will of a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? Am I ſure, that he is a Good Man? Or, if he be ſo to Day, how do I know but that he may be otherwiſe to Morrow? Nay, what Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity can be given me, that if he be a <hi>Saint</hi> this Hour, he will not be a <hi>Devil</hi> the next; ſince, the Temper of Man varies as often, and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:102956:141"/>ſuffers as many Alterations, as the Elements do, out of which he is compounded? Where then can be the Reaſon, of giving my ſelf wholly up to any Man's Diſpoſal all my Life Time? Is it not ſufficient to obey the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Prelate,</hi> who commands the whole <hi>Church,</hi> yet impoſes not the Dictates of his own Will as a Law, but governs all <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> according to the <hi>Antient Traditions, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Canons,</hi> and <hi>Decrees</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> and <hi>Councils?</hi> Whereas, thoſe who Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide over the <hi>Convents</hi> of the <hi>Religious,</hi> many Times rule arbitrarily, commanding their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to do thoſe Things, which are diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally oppoſite to the very Fundamental Rules of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and contrary to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi> The more I think on't, the greater is my Averſion for this private, blind Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt ſay, that a <hi>Regular Life</hi> is the Way of Perfection. I grant it; but cannot a Man lead a <hi>Regular Life,</hi> unleſs he be immur'd in a <hi>Convent?</hi> Or be <hi>Perfect,</hi> if his Mind be not ſquar'd to the Retirements of a <hi>Cloyſter?</hi> I will tell thee my Sentiments freely, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Maſque. The Nature of every Thing, is its Perfection: There are Perfect <hi>Sinners,</hi> as well as Perfect <hi>Saints.</hi> Thus we ſay, ſuch an one is a Perfect Drunkard, Fornicator, Cheat, Tyrant or the like. I ask thee, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this ſort of Perfection may not be (I wiſh I could ſay, is not too often actually) found, within the Walls of a <hi>Religious Houſe?</hi> On the other hand, doſt thou think it impoſſible,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:102956:141"/>to find the Perfection of Vertue, in the mix'd Life of the World? Be not a <hi>Cynick,</hi> nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn Things whereof thou haſt made no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment. Remember, how many Kings and Queens, Princes and Nobles have been <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized</hi> for <hi>Saints,</hi> who in the midſt of ſo many Splendors, kept their Eyes undazled. Whoſe Ears, never let in the Blandiſhments of Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, nor the malicious Whiſpers of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious. Whoſe Hands were never polluted with innocent Blood, nor their Thirſt quench'd with the Tears of Widows and Orphans. But, in all Things, they conſerv'd an inviolate Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Modeſty and Integrity of Manners.

                  <p>Aſſuredly, 'tis not impoſſible for a Man (let his Condition be what it will, Publick or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, Servile or Free) to conduct himſelf even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and by a Rule, through all the <hi>Meanders</hi> and <hi>Mazes</hi> of Humane Life. I muſt confeſs, This is very difficult, and all Men have not that <hi>Divine</hi> Art. Few can walk on Pinnacles, and not make falſe Steps; ſuch is our Life, and happy is he that makes the feweſt. Yet, there is a Dexterity, with which whoſoever is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, need not go to a <hi>Monaſtery,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the way to Bliſs.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt perhaps accuſe me, of too much Bluntneſs and ill Manners, in thus Declaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt that Kind of Life, which thou haſt enter'd into. But, pardon the Freedom I take

                  <p>A <hi>French</hi> Merchant, lately come from <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pahan,</hi> brings Intelligence, that the <hi>Chan</hi> of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>sbeck Tartars,</hi> is arrived at that City, to crave aid of the preſent <hi>Sophi</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Rebellious Children who have depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, and bereaved him of one of his Eyes. The <hi>Sophi</hi> has given him a Royal Reception, going himſelf in Perſon, above a League out of the City to meet him, accompanied with all his <hi>Nobles.</hi> This Gentleman came away, before the <hi>Tartarian Prince</hi> had ſucceeded in his Deſign. But, it was generally ſuppoſed, that <hi>Cha Abbas</hi> would aſſiſt him, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Army of <hi>Horſe</hi> and <hi>Foot,</hi> as alſo with Money to carry on the War.</p>
                  <p>This King is not Thirteen Years of Age, yet takes upon himſelf the Management of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:102956:142"/>Affairs. He is addicted to drinking of Wine a great Lover of Muſick and Women. Of a Noble Inclination, yet ſomething too Paſſionate. He commanded the Belly of one him <hi>Pages</hi> to be ript up, for breaking a Cryſtal Baſon which he much admired. Yet afterwards, repenting of what he had done, he cauſed him to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably buried, and a ſtately Tomb to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected over him. He alſo enquired out ſuch of his Kindred as were living, to whom he gave large Penſions.</p>
                  <p>There has been little of Action in theſe Parts, ſince the Signal Defeat that was given to the <hi>French,</hi> by the Forces of <hi>John de Wert,</hi> and <hi>General Merey.</hi> Four <hi>French Mareſchals</hi> were taken Priſoners, with all the Chief Officers, Six Thouſand Soldiers, beſides their Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Baggage.</p>
                  <p>In this Action, 'tis ſaid, the <hi>Spaniſh Horſe</hi> behaved themſelves very bravely, ſpurr'd on with an Ambition, to recover the Glory they ſeem'd to have loſt in ſo many Battels. They ruſh'd into the <hi>French</hi> Quarters, with a Fury which ſoon put them into Diſorder, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards diſpoſed them to quit the Field.</p>
                  <p>Before this Battel began, 'tis ſaid, there were ſeen Two Armies of Birds fighting in the Air; which engaged ſo furiouſly, that the Ground was cover'd with their Dead Bodies. And, that Morning, when one of the <hi>French Mareſchals</hi> was going out of his Tent, with a Piſtol in his Hand, in order to try it, the Barrel Split and tore his Hand in Pieces. Theſe are now looked upon as Prodigies, and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:102956:143"/>Signs of the Loſs they afterwards ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: but, had the Victory been on their Side, no Body would have taken Notice of them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>God</hi> that gives Victory when, and to whom he pleaſes, grant, that the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Arms may be ever ſucceſsful againſt the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.</hi>

                     <hi>To</hi> Oucoumiche <hi>his Mother, at</hi> Grand Cairo.</head>
                  <p>THOU mayſt better imagine than I can expreſs, the mighty Joy I felt, when I firſt opened thy Letter, and read the Name of her that conceiv'd me, written by her own Hand; whereby I am aſſur'd, that thou art yet alive and in Health. Believe me, it came in a ſeaſonable Time, to reſcue me out of a diſmal Melancholy, which had ſeized my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:102956:144"/>Surely, <hi>Fate</hi> directed thy Pen, and <hi>Providence</hi> timed the Arrival of the Veſſel which brought me this happy News from <hi>Africk,</hi> in the ſaddeſt Hour of all my Life. Juſt as the Meſſenger knock'd at my Chamber-Door (where I ſate overwhelm'd with dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Thoughts) the whole World ſeem'd to me a vaſt Wilderneſs or Deſert, inhabited only by Beaſts of Prey, where the Great and Strong, devour thoſe whoſe Weakneſs cannot arm them in their own Defence. A mere Stage of Tragedies, the Shambles of cruel Butcheries and Murders. In this Figure, did my troubled Imagination repreſent the <hi>Earth,</hi> with all the <hi>Race</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> dwelling upon it. If I could propoſe to my ſelf ſuch a Thing as a Friend in the World, I know not how long 'twould be, before that very Perſon whom I had greateſt Reaſon to eſteem as ſuch, might prove my Mortal Enemy; of ſo brittle a Compoſition is the Fidelity of Man. I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon my Life, not as my own, but alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether lent me; I eſteemed not onely Men, but Beaſts, and the very Inanimate Things, my Creditors, for the Permiſſion. I had to breathe. I thought my ſelf highly indebted to the Fire, that it did not burn me to Death in my Sleep; and no leſs to the Winds, that they did not blow the Houſe down where I lodge, and bury me in its Ruins. For, where would be the Injuſtice, if any of thoſe Elements which are the Ingredients of my Life, ſhould become the Inſtruments of my Death? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that as I neither made my ſelf, nor
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:102956:145"/>knew how I came to be what I am, ſo I was ignorant when and by what means I ſhould ceaſe to be. Perhaps, I might be ſtruck with a <hi>Thunderbolt</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> or ſwallowed up by ſome greedy <hi>Chaſm</hi> in the <hi>Earth.</hi> A Tile from a Houſe, might put a ſtop to the Motions of this Machine of Fleſh; or, a Fall from a Horſe, might break its Maſter-Springs. My preſent <hi>Station</hi> I looked upon as Preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, ſince thoſe very Perſons who appointed me this <hi>Employment</hi> to ſerve one Turn, would not Scruple to take off my Head to ſerve another.</p>
                  <p>In theſe melancholy Thoughts was I almoſt drown'd, when thy Letter came and ſtruck a Light out of the midſt of Darkneſs. I was now ready to die with Exceſs of Joy, who before was half killed with extreme Sadneſs.</p>
                  <p>But tell me, my Dear Mother, in the Name of our <hi>Holy Prophet,</hi> what Motive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced thee to quit the wholeſome Air of <hi>Greece,</hi> for the noiſom and peſtilential Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours of <hi>Aegypt?</hi> Is <hi>Cairo</hi> a more eligible Seat than <hi>Conſtantinople?</hi> Or, becauſe thou haſt loſt thy <hi>Second Husband,</hi> wilt thou be wedded to an Incurable Grief, and think no <hi>Mourning</hi> ſufficient, unleſs thou go in Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage to his very Grave, there to diſſolve in Tears, and mingle thy ſelf with his Aſhes. He died in <hi>Cairo,</hi> and is there interr'd; and thou mighteſt have liv'd in <hi>Scio,</hi> or any part of <hi>Greece,</hi> without blemiſhing thy Widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. People will ſay, thou aimeſt at the Fortune of the <hi>Epheſian</hi> Widow, who found
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:102956:145"/>a <hi>living Husband,</hi> in the Sepulchre of her <hi>dead one;</hi> but I, who know thy Vertue, have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Thoughts of thee; yet, I cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove thy thus becoming Tenant to a Charnel-Houſe. Therefore, the beſt Advice I can give thee, is, to return to the <hi>Imperial</hi> City again, to the Company of thy Friends and Acquaintance; or, at leaſt, return to thy ſelf, and be not tranſported with an extravagant Sorrow, for one whom thou ſhalt never ſee again. Tears cannot recover the Dead, nor can thy warmeſt Sighs inſpire him with Breath. He is divorc'd from thee by an Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable Law; and whilſt thou art in vain la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting for him on <hi>Earth,</hi> he may be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating new and joyful <hi>Nuptials</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> being eſpouſed to ſome of the <hi>Beautiful Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> Be perſwaded then, that he has quite forgot thee, having engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in freſh Amours above; That he is in the Arms of ſome <hi>Surpaſſing Beauty</hi> of <hi>Eden,</hi> and that thou haſt no more Intereſt in him. Let this Conſideration, aſſwage thy Grief, cure thy Fondneſs, and make thee begin to think of another Husband. Thoſe who make their firſt Viſits to the <hi>French</hi> Widows, after the uſual Formalities of Condoleance are over, take the Liberty to tell them, <hi>That they muſt live by the Living, and not by the Dead.</hi> This comfortable <hi>Proverb;</hi> is often uſed, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Funeral</hi> Solemnities are finiſ'd; and, thou haſt now paſſed away above Two Years ſince thy Husband's Death, in fruitleſs Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 'Tis Time to conſult thy future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:102956:146"/>and abandoning thy Commerce with the <hi>Dead,</hi> to become ſociable with the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Great Creator,</hi> who is <hi>God</hi> of the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> and not of the <hi>Dead,</hi> inſpire thee to take ſuch Meaſures, as may beſt comply with the Ends for which he made thee; and, repleniſh thy Latter Days, with double the Bleſſings of the Former.</p>

                  <p>IT is no ſmall Satisfaction to me, that ſince the Death of <hi>Cardinal Richlieu,</hi> I have ſtarted no Reaſons to apprehend any Deſigns in this <hi>Court,</hi> againſt the <hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>True Believers.</hi> The <hi>French Grandees,</hi> have paſs'd away a whole Year, without giving much Trouble or Alarm to the reſt of the World. Every one minds his own Affairs, and all puſh forward to get neareſt the <hi>Queen Regent.</hi> The Miſunderſtandings between her, and the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi> encreaſe daily. And, this divides the <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>City,</hi> into Two Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Cardinal Mazarini,</hi> ſeems to be the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:102956:146"/>Man deſtin'd to balance the Authority of both Parties. He Spins his Fortune, with as fine a Thread as his Predeceſſor; being ſenſible, that though the <hi>Court</hi> love him not, yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſubſiſt without him. He Inherits the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs</hi> and <hi>Inſtructions</hi> of <hi>Cardinal Richlieu,</hi> and his <hi>Spirit</hi> too, as well as his <hi>Miniſtry;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Man, of an Invincible Courage, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Forecaſt. The Greateſt Enemy he has, is a <hi>Lady</hi> of the <hi>Court</hi> (for, I will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Malice of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Beaufort</hi> to that of Woman) they call her, <hi>Madam de Chevereux;</hi> a Perſon of a keen Wit, and good Judgment; a profeſſed Enemy to all that had any Dependance on <hi>Cardinal Richlieu.</hi> And, I could never learn any other Ground of her Hatred to <hi>Mazarini,</hi> but his being the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of that <hi>Miniſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The late King had conceived an Irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable Averſion for this Lady, ſuſpecting her to be Inſtrumental in carrying on a Private Correſpondence between his Wife (the now <hi>Queen-Regent</hi>) and the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> To avoid the Conſequences of his Anger, ſhe fled into <hi>Spain,</hi> but is lately returned to this <hi>Court.</hi> 'Tis ſaid, the <hi>Queen</hi> received her with all the outward Marks of Affection at firſt, but ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly grew cold and eſtranged, when ſhe began to attempt againſt <hi>Cardinal Mazarini.</hi> This made the Lady unite her Intereſt with that of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> who very well matches her in the Imperiouſneſs of his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and his Hatred of the <hi>Cardinal.</hi> They both agree in their Endeavours to ruine him;
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:102956:147"/>but, I believe the Female Perſecution to be the moſt dangerous. The <hi>Duke</hi> has made too great a Noiſe, to do any conſiderable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution on a Man, who has the Wit to conceal his Reſentments, and ſtrike before he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd. In a word, the <hi>Duke</hi> finds himſelf in a Priſon, while the <hi>Cardinal</hi> is every Day more and more eſtabliſhed in the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, I inſinuate my ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Mens Company, from whom I can hope for any Intelligence. Among the Reſt, I have obſerved a <hi>Courtier,</hi> who often goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Grandees,</hi> and ſeems to be entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great Secrets; he is very ſparing of Words, and makes his Shoulders do the Office of his Tongue. I have ſometimes enter'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Diſcourſe with him about the <hi>Queen,</hi> the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> and others; but all his Anſwers, are comprized in <hi>Italian Rhetorick,</hi> a Shrug and a Grimace. This ſilent Language, ſpeaks very efficaciouſly to me, and I eſteem him worthy to be courted, who knows ſo well how to bridle his Tongue. I ply this <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> every Day with Addreſſes, and tell him a great deal of <hi>Feigned</hi> News, that I may tempt him to utter ſome that is <hi>True.</hi> He is a great. <hi>Privado</hi> of <hi>Madam de Chevereux;</hi> often waits on the <hi>Queen;</hi> ſometimes viſits the <hi>Cardinal;</hi> and is every Day converſant, with one or other of the <hi>Nobles.</hi> If I can win this Man, I hope to penetrate farther into the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of the <hi>Court.</hi>

                  <p>But I can reſolve thee, that there is nothing more of Truth in this Story, ſaving, that about Ten Veſſels of the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s, bound for <hi>Alexandria</hi> (on Board of one of which was <hi>Sultan Mahomet</hi>'s Nurſe, with her Son, much about the Age of <hi>Sultan Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>) were taken by Six Gallies of <hi>Malta,</hi>
                     <pb n="260" facs="tcp:102956:148"/>whereby the <hi>Malteſes</hi> were enriched with a great Treaſure of Silver, Gold and Jewels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Slaves.</p>
                  <p>This Intelligence I have received from my Correſpondents at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Men that are no Strangers to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> but ſuch as have the Ear of the <hi>Prime Vizir.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They ſay indeed, the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> took a particular Phancy to this Nurſes Child, often play'd with it, and ſeemed to careſs it with more Complacency, than his own Son <hi>Sultan Mahomet;</hi> which gave ſo great a diſguſt to the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that ſhe procured the Baniſhment of the Nurſe and her Child, who in their Voyage to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> were taken Captives by the <hi>Malteſe</hi> Galleys, as has been ſaid; and this is the Ground of the Report.</p>
                  <p>However, <hi>Sultan Ibrahim</hi> is ſo exaſperated againſt the <hi>Malteſes</hi> for this Depredation, that he has ſworn by <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Mahomet,</hi> never to ſheath his Sword, till he has revenged the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, by laying waſte the <hi>Iſland,</hi> putting the <hi>Knights</hi> to Death, and leading the Inhabitants into Captivity.</p>
                  <p>He has vented his Rage already on the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Baſſa,</hi> cauſing him to be ſtrangled, for not guarding the Seas better; and, 'tis ſaid, he threatens a War with <hi>Venice</hi> on the ſame Account, becauſe the <hi>Malteſe</hi> Galleys, after this Pyracy, put a Shore in <hi>Candia,</hi> where they recruted their Veſſels, with all neceſſary Proviſions.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> Ladies laugh at this Story, and ſay, That the <hi>Seraglio</hi> begins to grow more Civiliz'd, and to exchange the <hi>Severity</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> for the <hi>Gallantries</hi> of <hi>Paris.</hi>

                     <hi>To the</hi> Reis Effendi, <hi>Principal Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of the</hi> Ottoman Empire.</head>
                  <p>IT is not unknown at the <hi>Divan,</hi> how the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi> have worried one another theſe Two Years. I diſpatch'd long ago ſome <hi>Memoirs</hi> of the Feuds between the <hi>Barbarini</hi>'s and the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Parma.</hi> The <hi>Pope</hi> upholds the Former, making the Quarrel his own, in Defence of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtick State:</hi> The <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,</hi> the <hi>Grand Duke</hi> of <hi>Toſcany,</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Modena,</hi> with the <hi>French</hi> King, intereſt themſelves in the Cauſe of the Latter. He is a <hi>Prince</hi> of an Active Spirit, and darts up and down like Lightning through the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories. If he has loſt <hi>Caſtro, Montalto,</hi> and other Places of Strength in this War, it is but by Way of Exchange; having poſſeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of as conſiderable Holds belonging to his Enemies. Yet, the <hi>Barbarini</hi>'s ſheltring themſelves under the Protection of <hi>Pope <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi> ſeem to triumph and promiſe themſelves an entire Victory; uſing the Artifices of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, to weaken the <hi>Duke</hi>'s Credit. And becauſe ſome of his Veſſels (which carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a Thouſand Souldiers) were caſt away, they would perſwade the credulous World, that <hi>Heaven</hi> fights againſt him. They like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe had deſigned, to build a Fort and a Bridge over the River <hi>Po,</hi> to open a Way to
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:102956:150"/>themſelves into the <hi>Confederates</hi> Country, and to ſhut it up to all Invaders of their own; but were prevented by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who ſent Ten Thouſand Men to ſtop the Building of the Bridge, or to demoliſh it, if built.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, the <hi>Confederates</hi> though they ſeemed to eſpouſe the <hi>Duke</hi>'s Quarrel, yet trifled with him, protracting their Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and diſputing about <hi>Punctilio's;</hi> every one reſtraining the Conditions of their Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, within the Limits that would beſt ſquare with the Intereſt of their own <hi>State.</hi> They had all Armies on foot, but could not agree how to diſpoſe of them. The <hi>Venetians</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſuch a Poſt, as might be moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to that <hi>Republick.</hi> The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Toſcany,</hi> would have the main Body of their Forces ſo quartered, as to cover his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Thus, each Party purſued their own Claim, while their Enemies gained Time, and put themſelves in a Poſture, either to march into the <hi>Territories</hi> of the <hi>Confederates,</hi> or, defend the <hi>Eccleſiaſtick State.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Certainly, it is Fatal to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to be thus divided among themſelves, even when they have greateſt Cauſe of Union. Yet, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi> the very <hi>Soul</hi> of this <hi>Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy,</hi> breaks through all their Demurrs and Heſitations, impatient of fruitleſs Delays; ruſhes into <hi>Ferrara;</hi> takes <hi>Bondeno,</hi> abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Garriſon; after that, <hi>La Stellata,</hi> a Place of greater Strength; but, proceeding forward, the <hi>Barbarini</hi>'s encamped not far from <hi>Ferrara,</hi> the better to obſerve the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:102956:150"/>of the <hi>Confederates,</hi> and ſo put a ſtop to the Motions of the <hi>Duke.</hi> He and his Friends had Twenty Thouſand Men in the Field, to which the <hi>Venetians</hi> not long after, added Six Thouſand more. They were in different Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and as they quarter'd themſelves, ſo the <hi>Papal</hi> Forces remov'd their Camp. Several Skirmiſhes paſſed between them, but no great Execution done.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, the <hi>Venetians</hi> were not idle by Sea, having ſeveral Barks and Galleys full of arm'd Men, Coaſting along the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Territories. They took Five Forts on the Shore; and, piercing farther into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, made themſelves Maſters of <hi>Arriano,</hi> a great Town, and ſacked <hi>Codegoro,</hi> putting all to the Sword, and laying the Place in Aſhes.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, the <hi>Barberini's</hi> ſeized on <hi>Spilimberto, Vignivola,</hi> and ſome other weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guarded Towns on the Frontiers of <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and killed Two Hundred of the <hi>Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,</hi> who had inveſted <hi>Crevalcuore. Cardinal Antonio,</hi> on the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Side, has the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the War; a Man of an aſpiring <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and very ſubtle. He, perceiving the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Toſcany</hi> incenſed at the late Loſs, had taken the Field, with a conſiderable Army; ſends Six Thouſand Men to oppoſe him, but they were raw and undiſciplin'd Souldiers, and could not hinder the <hi>Duke</hi>'s Forces, from ſeizing an Important Paſs, and reducing the City of <hi>Pieve, Monteleone, Caſtiliano del Lago</hi> and <hi>Paſſiniano.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>War</hi> were thus buſied in
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:102956:151"/>the Field, the <hi>Agents</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> were not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on all Sides, to accommodate the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences that threatned all <hi>Italy</hi> with fatal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. But, they did no more than amuſe one another with Ambiguities, Subterfuges, and Evaſions; while the <hi>Barberini's</hi> ſought to gain Time, and draw the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to countenance their Intereſt. The <hi>Venetians,</hi> ſenſible of this underhand Dealing, proteſted by their Ambaſſador at <hi>Madrid,</hi> that they would unite with the <hi>French Crown,</hi> if his <hi>Catholick Majeſty,</hi> ſhould by indirect Ways ſtrengthen the <hi>Bearbrini's.</hi> The King, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of ſuch a League, forbears to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in an Affair which might be ſo Injurious to <hi>Spain,</hi> and gives Inſtructions to his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors at <hi>Rome</hi> and other <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> to mediate a Peace, which might be advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the <hi>Confederates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Treaties however came to nothing, and the Mediators finding themſelves eluded, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended their Negotiations, and gave freſh Opportunity to the Men of Arms to play their Parts. <hi>Cardinal Antonio</hi> aſſaulted <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantola</hi> with Four Thouſand Men, but was defeated by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who ſlew ſeveral Hundreds of his Souldiers, and took Two Hundred Priſoners. After this, the <hi>Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates</hi> plunder'd all the Country of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and took <hi>Vergato,</hi> defended by Eight Hundred Men. In the Surprizal of <hi>Bazano,</hi> they kill'd above Two Hundred of the Enemy; and, marching forward, took <hi>Monteria, Serra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valle,</hi> and other Places; while <hi>Cardinal Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berini</hi>'s
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:102956:151"/>Forces, were cut off at <hi>Burgho St. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polchro,</hi> where he loſt Eight Cannon, Four Petards, with Abundance of Proviſions.</p>
                  <p>It would be an endleſs Task, to recount all the Skirmiſhes and Battels, that have paſſed between them. I only inform thee of the moſt Remarkable, that thou maiſt inſert them in the <hi>Regiſter</hi> of the <hi>Ottoman Empire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude this Letter, it will be worth thy Obſervation, that the <hi>Pope</hi> falling Sick, and his Death feared, did much conduce to put an End to theſe Difference. For, the <hi>Barberini</hi>'s, now being apprehenſive of the Advantage his Death would give the <hi>Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Princes,</hi> were very forward to embrace any Overtures of <hi>Peace:</hi> So that by the Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity of the <hi>French Miniſters,</hi> it was at laſt concluded, and all Differences adjuſted; the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Parma</hi>'s Territories being reſtored to him, the <hi>Cenſures</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> taken off, and the <hi>Eccleſiaſtick State</hi> put in the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition it was in at the Beginning of the War.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall continue to ſend thee ſuch Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, as may be ſerviceable to thee in that Eminent Station thou enjoyeſt in the <hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>True Believers.</hi> And, ſhall think my ſelf a very happy Man, if I can by any Means acquire thy Favour.</p>

                  <p>ONE would think that there were yet ſome of the Ancient Race of <hi>Gyants</hi> on Earth. Here is a Man come to this <hi>Court,</hi> full Eight Foot high, a <hi>Finlander</hi> by Nation; he looks like ſome Poſthumous Birth of the Sons of <hi>Tatan.</hi> He is Maſter of prodigious Strength, and challenges any Two the ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Men in <hi>France,</hi> to throw him a Fall. I have ſeen him take Two Boys of Ten Years of Age on the Palm of each Hand, and lift them up from the Ground together, with his Arms ſtretched out to the full Length, and walk Sixty Paces with them in this Poſture; at the End of which Stage, he ſet them down again on their Feet, without the leaſt Violence or Straining. There are none ſo hardy, as to accept of his Challenge; for, they know he will not ſuffer them to come nearer than the Extremity of his Arm. And, ſuch is the monſtrous Strength of his Hand, that he will either infallibly throw them down, or ſtifle them with his Graſp. He talks of Travelling into <hi>Turkey;</hi> if he does, I hope he will have more Diſcretion, than to venture within the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> leſt he incurr the Fate of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Wreſtler, in <hi>Sultan A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murath</hi>'s Time. Thou remembreſt that <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy,</hi>
                     <pb n="269" facs="tcp:102956:152"/>which made all the Brave and the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, condemn <hi>Amurath</hi>'s Cruelty. He was a Stout <hi>Prince</hi> himſelf; and, it look'd like Envy in him, to puniſh the Efforts of Courage in his <hi>Slaves,</hi> with ſo unrelenting a Rigour. But, he was himſelf a Slave to his Paſſions; and, Jealouſie had the Predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in his Temper. That Vice betrayed him to horrid Violences, of which thou art not ignorant, having been privy to ſeveral of his Amours.</p>
                  <p>This puts me in mind of a <hi>Spaniſh Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,</hi> who had a very Vertuous and Beautiful Wife, which, thou wilt ſay, are Two rare Companions. He kept a <hi>Moor</hi> in his Houſe, whom the <hi>Lady</hi> had one Time caus'd to be ſeverely beaten. The <hi>Moor</hi> ſecretly vow'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. He had an Intrigue with one of the <hi>Lady's</hi> Women, to whom he imparted his Mind. They conſpired together, to accuſe the <hi>Lady</hi> of Lightneſs, and Infidelity to her Husband's Bed. The <hi>Cavalier,</hi> their Maſter was naturally Jealous, as generally are all the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> theſe Two poſſeſſed him with a Belief, that the <hi>Gardiner</hi> had frequent Acceſs to his <hi>Lady</hi>'s Chamber, and undertook to make him an Eye-Witneſs of it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, one of them goes privately to the <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner,</hi> and tells him, that the <hi>Lady</hi> would ſpeak with him. Whilſt the other runs to the <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>bids him make haſt; for, that the</hi> Gardiner <hi>was at that Inſtant with his</hi> Lady. The Impatient <hi>Cavalier</hi> haſtens up Stairs, and meeting the <hi>Gardiner</hi> coming out
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:102956:153"/>of the Door of his Chamber, ſtabs him to the Heart, without any farther Expoſtulation; and, ruſhing furiouſly into the Chamber, ſerves his Wife in the ſame Manner. But, coming down again, the Maid ſtruck with Remorſe at ſo black an event, fell down at his Feet, confeſſing her Crime, and declaring, that her <hi>Lady</hi> was Innocent. The <hi>Spaniard,</hi> raging Mad, at a Conjunction of ſo many Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, ſtabs the <hi>Maid</hi> and the <hi>Negro;</hi> and laſt of all, to complete the <hi>Tragedy,</hi> kills himſelf.</p>
                  <p>I have often wonder'd, that ſome ſuch fatal Conſequences did not attend the Jealouſie of <hi>Sultan Amurath.</hi> He ſpared not to rip up the Bellies of his <hi>Pages,</hi> for the Sake of Two or Three <hi>Melons;</hi> and, 'tis a Miracle, that he did not ſacrifice half the <hi>Slaves</hi> of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> on the Account of his <hi>Miſtreſſes.</hi>

                  <p>When it was firſt inſtituted it conſiſted of Twelve <hi>Peers,</hi> an Hundred <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and all the <hi>Prime Nobility</hi> of the Land; who had power to give Audience to Foreign <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors;</hi> to adjuſt all Differences of the Subjects.

They never pretended to meddle with <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Affairs; that was always out of their Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The <hi>Mufti</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> claims this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative as his Right. From whence thou mayeſt obſerve, how maim'd and imperfect is the Royalty of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Kings, who cannot puniſh their own Subjects, if <hi>Clergy-men,</hi> without the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Permiſſion. Yet, though this <hi>Chamber</hi> cannot meddle with the <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticks,</hi> they have a Privilege to diſpoſe of the <hi>Regency,</hi> during the King's Minority; as is evident in the late <hi>Queen-Mother, Mary de Medicis,</hi> and the preſent <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who were both by the <hi>Parliament</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Regents.</hi> They alſo confirm all the Kings <hi>Edicts;</hi> neither does he proclaim <hi>War</hi> without their Conſent, or eſtabliſh any <hi>Alliance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are alſo beſides this, Six other <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> of <hi>Parliament;</hi> Five whereof, are called <hi>Chambers</hi> of <hi>Inqueſts,</hi> and they conſiſt of Two <hi>Preſidents,</hi> Twenty <hi>Counſellors,</hi> and a convenient Number of <hi>Lawyers.</hi> The Sixth <hi>Chamber</hi> is a Collection out of all the Reſt,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:102956:154"/>and contains no leſs than Two Hundred Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. Here, all <hi>Criminal</hi> Cauſes are tryed; which are either immediately, or by Appeal brought before them. As in the Chambers of <hi>Inqueſts,</hi> Controverſies of the <hi>Civil Law</hi> are decided.</p>
                  <p>It is a pleaſant Sight, to ſee the Men of the <hi>Law</hi> all in their <hi>Habits,</hi> which are very Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Rich. Indeed, all the Citizens of <hi>Paris,</hi> are extremely Gallant in their Apparel. But, I cannot be reconciled to their laviſh Cuſtom, of changing the Faſhion of their Clothes almoſt with every <hi>Moon.</hi> This Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity has been forbid in all well-ordered <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths.</hi> And, thou knoweſt, our <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern</hi> People would as ſoon be ſtript of their Skins, as change the Faſhion, which has been in uſe for immemorable Ages. Here they have no Diſtinction of Dreſs, the Noble and Vulgar, Rich and Poor go all alike. You cannot diſcern a <hi>Slave</hi> from a <hi>Prince</hi> by his Garb.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paris</hi> is divided into Four Parts, the <hi>City,</hi> the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity,</hi> the <hi>Town,</hi> and the <hi>Suburbs.</hi> It is about Three Leagues in Circuit; ſeated advantageouſly enough, but wanting Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. <hi>Henry</hi> IV. had added ſome Strength to it, had he not been apprehenſive of the Seditious Humour of the Inhabitants, who in time might make an ill Uſe of his Kindneſs, and ſhut thoſe Gates againſt him, which he ſhould build for their Defence againſt a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Enemy.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Court</hi> is generally at St. <hi>Germain en Lay</hi>
                     <pb n="274" facs="tcp:102956:155"/>one of the King's Royal Manſions, ſeated on the Top of a Mountain, which commands a Proſpect of a large and beautiful Valley. I have been there often, that I might be the better able to penetrate into the Conduct of <hi>Cardinal Mazarini,</hi> who is never from the <hi>Queen-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</hi> I have already tranſmitted to the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Port,</hi> ſuch Intelligence as I could gain of this <hi>Great Miniſter</hi>'s Intrigues. I will now entertain thee with a Glimpſe of this <hi>Palace,</hi> that thereby thou mayſt conjecture at the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificence of the King's of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is divided into Two Parts, the <hi>Old</hi> and the <hi>New.</hi> The Former was built by <hi>Charles</hi> I. the Latter by <hi>Henry</hi> IV. That may boaſt of its Antiquity, but this is ſo Majeſtick and Coſtly a Structure, as ſufficiently demonſtrates, that <hi>Modern Architects</hi> come not far ſhort of the <hi>Ancient Romans.</hi> The Rooms are all lofty and large, the Roofs and Ceilings admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably contriv'd and adorn'd; the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of ſo many Courts, that it rather looks like a Town than the Seat of one Family.</p>
                  <p>But pardon me, Illuſtrious <hi>Kaimacham,</hi> if I tell thee, that none of the Kings of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> can match this <hi>Monarch</hi> in the Gardens belonging to this <hi>Palace.</hi> I ſaw there, ſuch a Charming Variety of Delightful Objects, as made <hi>Art</hi> ſeem to ſurpaſs <hi>Nature,</hi> and even to out-do it ſelf. In a Word, the <hi>Chriſtian Princes,</hi> are very ingenious in the Contrivance of their Pleaſures, and make all the Elements contribute to their Recreations. Thou haſt often ſeen the Artificial Fireworks which are
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:102956:155"/>exhibited at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> at our <hi>Feſtivals,</hi> and on all Occaſions of Publick Joy. But, thou haſt never beheld ſuch <hi>Water-works,</hi> as are expoſed in the Gardens of this Palace eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Day. There, by the mere Force of this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid Element, Inſtruments of <hi>Muſick</hi> are ſet at Work, which afford a Harmony little Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the beſt Conſorts in the World; and, which extremely adds to the Pleaſure, one may at the ſame Time behold ſeeming <hi>Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> playing on them, and keeping as exact Time with their Fingers on the Keys of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, Strings of Viols and Lutes, as if they were living Perſons. There you may ſee, all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Mechanick Trades exerciſed by Statues, who do every Thing with a proper Action, and are very eager at their Employments, ſo long as the Water gives them Motion; when that ceaſes, they all return to their Primitive Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctivity. From hence you paſs to a ſeeming Sea, with <hi>Tritons</hi> moving on <hi>Dolphins,</hi> and ſounding their Shell-Trumpets before <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> who is drawn in a Chariot by Four <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſes.</hi> The Story of <hi>Perſeus</hi> and <hi>Andromeda,</hi> is alſo acted to the Life by mere <hi>Statues.</hi> But the moſt Ingenious Piece of Workmanſhip, is, <hi>Orpheus</hi> playing on a Viol, while the Trees move, and Wild Beaſts dance round about him. This is ſo coſtly an Invention, that, as one of the <hi>Overſeers</hi> of the <hi>Water-works</hi> told me, a String of <hi>Orpheus</hi>'s Viol being broken, coſt the late King <hi>Lewis</hi> Thirteen Hundred Crowns to repair it again.</p>
                  <p>We <hi>Mahometans,</hi> are apt to value our ſelves
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:102956:156"/>too high, on the Score of our <hi>Princes</hi> Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur. We boaſt, we flouriſh, and are guilty of a Thouſand Inſults, deſpiſing and putting the reſt of Mankind under our Sandals; as, if none of the <hi>Race</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> underſtood the World but we, or had the Wit and Power to carve out to themſelves the ſame Felicities we enjoy. The <hi>Monarchs</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> ſtyle themſelves, <hi>The only Happy ones, Poſſeſſors of infinite Treaſures; Kings of the World, Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of God,</hi> and what not! The <hi>Great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gol,</hi> with his <hi>Omrah's</hi> and <hi>Raja's,</hi> pride them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their <hi>Elephants.</hi> So do the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Mandarins</hi> of <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Tunquin.</hi> The <hi>Sophi</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> ſwells at the Sight of his immenſe Treaſures of Gold and precious Stones; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, that the very Shooes of his Horſes, are of the moſt exalted Metal; alſo the Mangers wherein they feed, and the Nails whereby they are faſten'd to the Ground. The <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi> rejoices in the Multitude and Strength of his Horſes, his Winged Chariots and Waggons, and, that when his Armies riſe and ſit down, the Earth trembles with their Weight and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 'Tis true indeed, the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> who is the <hi>Wiſeſt</hi> of the <hi>Wiſe,</hi> and the <hi>Greateſt</hi> of theſe <hi>Great Ones,</hi> is not guilty of this Vanity. He is deſtin'd by the <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:102956:156"/>the Garden belonging to it, is a perfect <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript</hi> of <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> Thou wilt not approve ſuch Brags as theſe, when thou conſidereſt, how expert the <hi>Infidels</hi> are in Building; and, that they ſpare no Coſt to erect ſuch Edifices, whoſe very Ruins may proclaim to future A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, the Magnificence of their Founders. And, as to their Gardens, they are ſo regular and beautiful, adorn'd with ſo many Delicacies of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Art,</hi> that one would think, they were made by ſome Traditional <hi>Diſciples</hi> of <hi>Adam;</hi> and, that they had their Rules, from the <hi>Primitive Planter</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi>

                  <p>SInce the Loſſes which the <hi>German Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> has received from the Arms of <hi>Ragot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ski,</hi> I am inform'd by <hi>Nathan Ben Saddi,</hi> that the <hi>Emperor</hi> deſigns to ſend a ſplendid Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy with extraordinary Preſents to the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> in Hopes to prevail on him, not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect that Prince.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, <hi>Ragotski</hi> is of a violent and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable Nature, and therefore no great Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is to be repoſed in him. Yet, I take it to be the Intereſt of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> rather to win him by Offices of Kindneſs and Friendſhip, than to make him his Enemy, by deſerting him in this Juncture.</p>
                  <p>He is at the Head of a Potent and Formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Army, has taken <hi>Solnock, Breden, Mernatz,</hi> together with the ſtrong Caſtle of <hi>Sendar</hi> near <hi>Caſſovia;</hi> and many other Places of leſs Importance, whereby a Way is laid open for his Army to over-run all <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> if aſſiſted with the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Forces.

                  <p>Should the <hi>Sultan</hi> deſert him now, he may be compelled to reſign himſelf, with all <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania,</hi> to the Protection of the <hi>German Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.</hi> It is not ſafe to run the Riſque of ſuch an Event; <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> cannot ſupport it ſelf.

                  <p>THE <hi>Pagans,</hi> in painting <hi>Fortune</hi> Blind, diſcovered but the Dimneſs of their own Sight. And 'twas a double Errour, to offer <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to her, that could not diſcern her <hi>Votaries.</hi> Yet, in my Sentence, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are more to blame, who term her Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, Partial, Bawd, Whore, and what not?
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:102956:158"/>Theſe are Prophanations of <hi>Providence,</hi> and impious Scandals caſt on <hi>Eternal Deſtiny. Fortune</hi> and <hi>Chance,</hi> are but Nick-names of <hi>Fate,</hi> ſince there is nothing abſolutely Caſual in the World. They ſee the Vertuous perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, while the Vicious inſult and flouriſh; and they tax <hi>Heaven</hi> with unequal Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Rewards and Puniſhments; as if with <hi>Epicurus,</hi> they thought the Adorable <hi>Numen,</hi> took no Care of Things on this Side the <hi>Empy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeum,</hi> and reſted in an Eternal Ignorance of Humane Affairs.</p>
                  <p>Doubtleſs, the <hi>Infidels</hi> are in an incurable Error. They pore on the Outſide of Common Events, and look no farther; they behold not the <hi>hidden Chain</hi> of <hi>Cauſes,</hi> nor the <hi>Inviſible Hand,</hi> which diſpoſes all Contingencies with admirable Order and <hi>Decorum.</hi> Hence it is, that what comes not to paſs but by the certain <hi>Decree</hi> of <hi>Fate,</hi> appears to theſe Buzzards, only as an Accidental Occurrence, and the mere Effect of <hi>Chance.</hi>

                  <p>But thou, who art inſtructed in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Truth, wilt have other Thoughts of that, which befell a Poor Man not long ſince in theſe Parts. This Perſon was Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable to Exceſs; for, he gave away all that he had, to relieve the Neceſſities of others, chuſing rather to throw himſelf naked upon <hi>Providence,</hi> than to deny an Alms to any One that ask'd him; ſo long as he had any Thing to beſtow. Being at length, by his conſtant Liberalities, reduced to a very indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Condition, he was forced to betake
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:102956:158"/>himſelf to Digging for his Livelihood. Yet, notwithſtanding he gained his own Bread with hard Labour, he ceaſed not to ſhew his wonted Kindneſſes to the Poor, giving them whatſoever he could poſſibly ſpare from his own Neceſſities. One Day, as he was digging in a Field belonging to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> he found ſeveral Earthen Pots full of Gold, ſuppoſed to be buried there in the Time of the <hi>Civil Wars.</hi> The good Man carries this huge Treaſure by Degrees home to his Houſe, with all imaginable Privacy. And, having diſtributed the greateſt Part of it in Works of Charity, he was going with his laſt Reſerve to the Houſe of a decayed Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, to whom he gave a ſufficient Sum to repair his ſhatter'd Fortunes, being all that he had left: When, as he returned home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, he found a Jewel in the High-way, which being ſold, yielded him Ten Thouſand Crowns. A Noble Bank for new Liberalities, and a convincing Argument, that there was ſomething more than <hi>Chance,</hi> which thus ſtrangely recruited his Purſe, that it might never ceaſe to be opened in Largeſſes to the Poor.</p>
                  <p>Who will not ſay, That <hi>Fate</hi> had a Hand in the Death of that Souldier, in the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Anguien</hi>'s Army, who maliciouſly and wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accuſed his Comrade, of raiſing a Mutiny?

I my ſelf once ſaw Two mighty Armies mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall'd in the Air, who acted all the Bloody Tragedies of War, and made <hi>Arabia</hi> deaf with the Noiſe of their Artillery; yet, not a Cloud at that time to be ſeen. But I remark'd no extraordinary Event to follow it. 'Tis hard to trace the <hi>Omnipotent</hi> in ſuch Myſterious Works, or learn the Drift of <hi>Providence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I deſire thee to uſe thy utmoſt Diligence, to penetrate into the Deſigns of the <hi>Court</hi> where thou reſideſt. 'Tis an Honourable Poſt, to ſerve the <hi>Greateſt Monarch</hi> in the World. Be Faithful and Vigilant, ſo may <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> heap greater Favours on thee. Adieu.</p>

                     <hi>To</hi> Solyman Aga, Chief Eunuch <hi>of the Women.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>I Perceive by thy Letters, that our <hi>Heroick Sultan</hi> is very Induſtrious to take off the Scandal of Impotence, which the Ladies at his firſt Acceſſion to the <hi>Throne</hi> faſtned on him, having now ſeen a Fourth Son, born to him in the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> The Multitude of <hi>Subjects,</hi> is the Glory of a <hi>Monarch,</hi> and a ſtrong Defence in Time of War; and, the Multitude of the Prince's Children, is the Security of his People both in War and Peace.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Adventure, as he was going to <hi>Scutary,</hi> puts me in mind of an Accident, which befell one of the Ancient King of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi> who, as he was walking in the <hi>Royal</hi> Garden at <hi>Memphis,</hi> ſpyed an Eagle flying toward the Place, where he was; at which Sight he ſtood ſtill, gazing on the King of Birds; till at length the Eagle arriving to that part of the Air which was over his Head, lets fall a Woman's Shooe at his Feet. The King ſurprized at this Accident, takes up the Shooe; and, ſurveying its exquiſite Symmetry and Form, thence took his Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Lady that had worn it, and ſuddenly grew enamour'd of the unknown Fair; proclaiming through all <hi>Aegypt,</hi> great
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:102956:161"/>Rewards to any that could diſcover the Owner of that Shooe. At length, a certain Beautiful Courtezan of <hi>Naucretis,</hi> named <hi>Rhodope,</hi> was proved to be the Miſtreſs of it; who being brought to the King's Preſence, he took her to his Bed, making her the Partner of his <hi>Empire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Lady had a much better Fate, than the tall <hi>Armenian</hi> Woman, with whom <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Ibrahim</hi> fell in Love on the like Occaſion: For, <hi>Rhodope,</hi> after ſhe had enjoyed her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour many Years, at laſt died peaceably in her Bed, and was Entombed in one of the <hi>Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mids</hi> of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> Whereas, thou telleſt me, that this <hi>Armenian,</hi> ſoon after her Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Embraces, was ſtrangled by the <hi>Queen-Mother</hi>'s Command. I tell thee, it was a Bold and Cruel Act; and, were the <hi>Sultan</hi> ſenſible how ſhe was Murdered, he would not ſpare to vent his Indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her that bare him.</p>

                     <hi>To</hi> Dgnet Oglou.</head>
                  <p>ONE would think it an eaſie Matter, for a Stranger to conceal himſelf, in ſo vaſt and Populous a City as is <hi>Paris.</hi> Eſpecially, one who makes ſo mean and contemptible a Figure, as does the ſuppoſed <hi>Titus</hi> of <hi>Molda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via.</hi> I little thought, that the <hi>Lowneſs</hi> of my <hi>Stature,</hi> and the <hi>Deformity</hi> of my <hi>Body,</hi> would have attracted any Curious Eyes; but, that my very <hi>Habit,</hi> would have protected me from all Suſpicion, and, that I might have paſs'd an Age undiſcovered, amongſt the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Crowds of People, who throng both the Houſes and Streets of <hi>Paris.</hi> Yet, there are ſome Critical Moments of our Lives wherein <hi>Fate</hi> delights to ſport with us, to throw Stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-Blocks in our Way, to entangle us in Difficulties and Perils. This is a neceſſary Diſcipline of <hi>Heaven,</hi> to rowze Men from the Lees of Security, and Confidence in their own Strength and Abilities, and to inſtruct us, <hi>That</hi> Providence <hi>alone can extricate as out of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinths we often fall into.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I was walking Yeſterday before the <hi>Great Temple</hi> of this City, which is dedicated to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the <hi>Mother</hi> of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> when, on a ſudden, I was accoſted (by one whom I little imagin'd to have ſeen in <hi>Paris</hi>) with theſe Words;
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:102956:162"/>
                     <hi>Mahmut! How came you by this</hi> Habit? <hi>What make you in this</hi> Place? <hi>Are you a</hi> Chriſtian, <hi>or do you thus diſguiſe your ſelf for other Ends?</hi> Thou mayſt eaſily imagine, what a Terror ſeized me, when I knew that he who ſpoke to me, was my <hi>old Maſter</hi> at <hi>Palermo.</hi> It brought to my Remembrance all the cruel Blows and Stripes I had received, during that irkſom Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; and I could almoſt have phanſy'd my ſelf ready for the <hi>Baſtinado.</hi> However, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling my Confuſion, I anſwered briskly, <hi>Sir, you are miſtaken in the Perſon; my Name is not</hi> Mahmut, <hi>but</hi> Titus. <hi>I am a</hi> Chriſtian <hi>and a</hi> Catholick; <hi>if you are ſuch your ſelf, you have no Reaſon to upbraid my</hi> Habit, <hi>ſince I wear it as a Badge of my</hi> Profeſſion, <hi>being a</hi> Student, <hi>and</hi> Candidate <hi>of the</hi> Prieſthood.</p>
                  <p>This Anſwer, inſtead of ſatisfying him, did but augment his Jealouſie; and, being of a Paſſionate Temper, he broke out into fierce Language, calling me, <hi>Turk, Infidel, Slave, Dog,</hi> and all the ill Names his Fury could ſuggeſt. He ſpoke ſo loud, that it was taken Notice of by the People as they walked by, who began to gather about us, to learn the Occaſion of ſo much Noiſe. I then condemn'd my ſelf, for not rather owning my ſelf to him, and inviting him to ſome more retired Place, where I might give him an Account of my Circumſtances. I look'd upon my ſelf as a dead Man, and would gladly have ſuſtained Seven Years of Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude again in <hi>Sicily,</hi> to have been rid of the Fear I was now under, of a more terrible Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:102956:162"/>
                  <p>While I was in this Confuſion of Spirit, thinking of Nothing but Racks and Tortures, the Noiſe of the Rabble, who flock'd about us, had alarm'd the People that were at their <hi>Devotions</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> who came running out, to enquire the Cauſe of ſuch a Tumult: Among the Reſt, a <hi>Friar,</hi> eminent for his Learning and Vertue, and who had a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Eſteem and Friendſhip for me, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Matter, came up cloſe to me, and taking me by the Hand, ſpoke aloud theſe Words: <hi>Sirs, forbear to Injure a Stranger in the</hi> Court <hi>of the</hi> Mother <hi>of</hi> God. <hi>I know this Man very well, and will be Reſponſible for him; he is a</hi> Catholick-Clerk, <hi>and</hi> Servant <hi>of the</hi> Living God. The Rabble gave a great Shout at the End of this Harangue; and, had not my <hi>Sicilian</hi> Maſter made a narrow eſcape, they would have endangered to tear him in Pieces. I know not what became of him afterwards, but I attended the <hi>Friar</hi> into the <hi>Temple,</hi> where we ſtaid during the <hi>Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration</hi> of their <hi>Maſs;</hi> and, then he condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted me through the inner Parts of the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> by private ways into the Lodgings of the <hi>Prieſts;</hi> whence we iſſu'd out by a <hi>Poſtern,</hi> and, taking Boat, we croſs'd the River <hi>Seine</hi> into the Fields. The <hi>Friar</hi> congratulated my Eſcape from the Hands of the Multitude; and, I return'd him a Thouſand Thanks, for lifting me out of the Mire.</p>
                  <p>Thou ſeeſt, Dear Friend, that the <hi>Arabian Proverb</hi> ſpeaks not in vain, when it ſays; <hi>That the Habitation of Danger, is on the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:102956:163"/>of Security:</hi> And, <hi>That a Man never runs greater Hazards, than when he leaſt fears them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that turns the Scales of Life and Death, Good and Evil, grant, that ſome happy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergency may always ariſe, to divert the Perils which thou ſhalt incurr in this Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Life.</p>

                  <p>THIS <hi>Court</hi> is now in <hi>Mourning,</hi> for the Death of the Chief <hi>Mufti,</hi> or <hi>Pope.</hi> And indeed, there ſeems to be more than mere Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony in it, he having all along favoured the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt.

                     <hi>There have lately been extraordinary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations in the</hi> Senate <hi>about theſe Affairs, ſome diſapproving theſe Warlike Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, others promoting them: One Party judging, that a Peace ought rather to be purchaſed with a Tender of Gold: A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Side pleading, that ſuch a Purchaſe would be both diſhonourable and diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous; ſince upon every new Diſguſt, the</hi> Ottomans <hi>would commence, or, at leaſt, threaten a War, on purpoſe, to erect a continual Mart for Peace, the Sale thereof being like to prove ſo profitable to them.

                  </p>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:102956:165"/>
                  <p>THIS Glorious <hi>Republick,</hi> which has flouriſh'd for ſo many Ages, ought not, in my Opinion, to become the Merchandiſe of up-ſtart Shepherds. 'Tis needleſs, to recount our Original, or wipe off the Ancient Duſt of our Primitive Records, that we may be able to tell the World, we are the <hi>Reliques</hi> of <hi>Troy.</hi> 'Tis bootleſs, to put you in Mind, how this moſt ſerene and flouriſhing <hi>State,</hi> laid her first Foundations in the Sea, and built her Neſt in the Floods: That the <hi>Nereids</hi> fled to her Shadow; and, the Reſt of the <hi>Sea-Gods,</hi> even <hi>Neptune</hi> himſelf, courted her Alliance and Protection. Suffice it to ſay, that this <hi>Victorious State</hi> thus founded and built, has ſpread her Conqueſts through <hi>Iſtria, Dalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> and <hi>Epirus;</hi> has annexed unto her Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <hi>Corfu, Cephalenia, Zant,</hi> and <hi>Crete,</hi> with many other <hi>Iſlands</hi> of the <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atick,</hi> and <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Seas; and, that this <hi>Virgin Commonwealth,</hi> has preſerved her ſelf undeflowred theſe Twelve Hundred Years.

Suffer not your ſelves, Moſt Excellent <hi>Lords,</hi> to be cajoled by the ſpecious Pretences of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Fox, but confide in your own Illuſtrious Arms, and the Juſtice of your Cauſe, which will not fail to attract the Favours of <hi>Divine Providence.</hi> Let not thoſe Laurels, which have been all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long ſprinkled with the Noble Bloud of your Renowned Anceſtors, be tamely taken from your Heads, and trampled under the Feet of <hi>Infidels.</hi> Whom do you fear?

But what do you dread?

I feel already in my Mind, bliſsful Preſages of a laſting Peace, the effect of a <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable War,</hi> which is much to be preferred to the <hi>precarious Truce</hi> (for it deſerves no better Title) which they deſign to cheat us with, in Contemplation of our Gold; a <hi>Truce,</hi> which they will break at Pleaſure, to Start new Grounds of Compoſition. Thus, could we drain the <hi>Indies</hi> dry, we muſt refund our Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure into the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Coffers, and all too little to ſatiate their Greedy Avarice, and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Demands. Thus would the moſt <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Republick</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> be poſt-pon'd to the <hi>Divan</hi> of <hi>Algiers;</hi> who have already ſhaken off the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Yoke, retaining indeed the ſervile Name of <hi>Subjects,</hi> but refuſing the Tribute they were wont to pay. Let us not ſuffer that <hi>Barbarous Little State,</hi> thus No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to aſſert their <hi>Liberty,</hi> whilſt we reſign our Necks to the <hi>Yoke.</hi> Our Fleets are
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:102956:166"/>numerous, our Soldiers diſciplin'd, our Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men bold and expert, our Treaſury full of the Nerves of War.

                     <hi>To</hi> Mirza Muhammed Effendi, Vicar <hi>to the</hi> Mufti.</head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Jews</hi> have a <hi>Proverb, That he who breeds not up his Son to ſome Trade, makes him a Thief.</hi> And the <hi>Arabians</hi> ſay, <hi>That an idle Perſon is the Devil's Play-fellow.</hi> Therefore, our <hi>Holy,</hi> and <hi>Wiſe Lawgiver,</hi> has commanded all <hi>True Believers,</hi> to exerciſe themſelves every Day in ſome <hi>Manual</hi> Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation. Neither is the <hi>Sultan</hi> on his <hi>Throne,</hi> any more exempted from Obedience to this <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Precept,</hi> than he who cleans the Streets. The Soul of Man, is active as Fire; or, to take our Compariſon as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> do from another Element, It can no more
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:102956:167"/>ceaſe from being buſie, than Water can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it ſelf from running out of every Hole of a Sieve. Men will be always exerting their Faculties one way or other, and there is no <hi>Medium</hi> between Good and Evil: Whoſoever is not employ'd in One, muſt neceſſarily fall into the Other. Theſe are the Points to which all the Lines of Humane Actions tend, the Centers where all our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs meet. But, though there be no ſuch Thing as a Mediocrity between theſe Two Extremes, and every Man is within the Circumference either of Vertue or Vice: Yet, there are certain Steps and Degrees in each; Specifick Differences alſo, which take their Riſe and Proportions from Nature, Morality and Religion. Thus, <hi>Humane Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> teaches us, of Two Evils to chuſe the leaſt; while the <hi>Divine Oracle</hi> inſtructs us, Not to ſtand upon Niceties and <hi>Punctilio's</hi> with Vertue, but to puſh forward till we arrive at an Heroick Generoſity.</p>
                  <p>As for me, who ſerve the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> in this Station, I am forced to compound with the <hi>Law,</hi> and capitulate with the <hi>Severer Precepts</hi> of the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> I tell many a <hi>Lye,</hi> that I may do the more effectual Service to <hi>Truth.</hi> I am compell'd to deny my <hi>Religion,</hi> that I may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a Way for others to propagate it. By ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique and remote Fetches of Policy, I accompliſh the Direct Intentions of Juſtice, while I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit little Vices among the <hi>Infidels,</hi> to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce great Vertues. Thus, making good the Counſel of the <hi>Perſian Philoſopher, That it is
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:102956:168"/>neceſſary for him who would reach his Journeys End, ſometimes to go round about.</hi> And, thou knoweſt what Encouragement has been given me; being aſſur'd by the <hi>Sovereign Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> of our <hi>Holy Law,</hi> That while I keep in the Orb of my Duty to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> I am out of the <hi>Devil's Circle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If thou wouldſt know how I buſie my ſelf at my Hours of Leiſure: I make Watches; not knowing how better to ſpend my vacant Time, than in framing an Inſtrument, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I may perceive how Time paſſes away. This little Engine, points out each Minute, and meaſures exactly the Succeſſion of Hours; it keeps Pace with Years, yet out-runs not Months. 'Tis the <hi>Journal</hi> of the Sun, a <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Record</hi> of his daily Travel through the <hi>Heavens.</hi> In a Word, 'tis the <hi>Secretary</hi> of <hi>Time;</hi> and a <hi>compendious Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Firſt-born Iſſue</hi> of <hi>Eternity.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Eliachim</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> takes ſome off my Hands; and, the Reſt I preſent to the <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees,</hi> or any Body whom I would oblige. I have ſent ſome by the Way of <hi>Vienna</hi> to the moſt <hi>Venerable Mufti,</hi> and to thy ſelf, as alſo to others of my Friends at the <hi>Sublime Port.</hi> They are all ſeal'd up, with Directions to thoſe for whom they are Deſigned.

                  <p>THOU that art exalted from a <hi>Page,</hi> to one of the Higheſt Dignities in the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> and poſſeſſeſt an Eminent Share of the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Favour, wilt not be diſpleaſed if <hi>Mahmut,</hi> whom thou haſt formerly honour'd with thy Friendſhip, puts thee in Mind of ſome Qualifications that are requiſite in a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite. I know thy Abilities are great, yet he that walks on Pinnacles, will not refuſe the Aſſiſtance of any kind Hand that offers it, nor tax a Man with Preſumption, for endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to preſerve him from a Fall.</p>
                  <p>It will not be ſufficient, that thou art very
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:102956:169"/>Zealous to ſerve the <hi>Sultan,</hi> to aggrandize his Honour, and prop the Imperial Dignity: Nor, that thou art extremely accurate in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging the Affairs committed to thy Charge: That thou art aſſiduous and extraordinary careful; not addicted to Recreations and Pleaſure: That thou art rigorouſly Juſt, deaf to Flattery, and inexorable to Bribes; but in all Things ſollicitous for thy Sovereigns Intereſt and Greatneſs, without any other Byaſs, ſave that of untainted Loyalty. (All theſe, I muſt confeſs, are great Vertues in a Stateſman and a Favourite; yet, they may become Vices, by their Exceſs as well as their Defect; and he that ſteers not his Courſe in the <hi>Golden Mean,</hi> may ſoon preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate himſelf into Ruine.) But it is alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for thee, to have an Eye to the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Subject, as well as to the Prince's Prerogative. It will not be ſafe to immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Peoples Intereſts and Liberties, to the Humours and Caprices of their Sovereign. Neither will he thank or reward thee, for ſuch a dangerous Piece of Zeal. Nay, ſhould he himſelf command thee to do any Thing, which would intrench on their Rights and Privileges, thou oughteſt rather to ſhew thy Fidelity, in humbly remonſtrating to him the ill Conſequences of ſuch a Proceeding, than by a blind Obedience, to betray both him and thy ſelf to the Publick <hi>Odium.</hi> On thee, to be ſure, it will faſten, however thy Maſter may eſcape; and, thou muſt fall a Victim, to appeaſe the incens'd Multitude and ſave him harmleſs.</p>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:102956:169"/>
                  <p>This was the Caſe of the <hi>Duke d' Olivares,</hi> the late Miniſter and Favourite of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> He was endued, with all the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Vertues requiſite in a Stateſman; but, his immenſe Zeal to advance the Kings Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, betrayed him to ſuch Meaſures of Oppreſſion and Tyranny, as were the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Ruine.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> claim certain Franchiſes and Immunities, which when granted them, they pay a voluntary Homage to the <hi>Caſtilian</hi> Crown. <hi>D' Olivares</hi> ſought to bereave them of theſe their Native Cuſtoms and Liberties, which by degrees gave ſo general a Diſguſt to that apprehenſive Nation, that they broke out into an open Rebellion. Hence ſprung the Revolt of <hi>Catalonia</hi> and <hi>Roſſilion;</hi> and, the total Defection of <hi>Portugal.</hi> He thought by Rigour, to drive theſe People to Extremes, making them fall into Treaſon, and then taking advantage of their Crimes, to make his Maſter more abſolute. But, theſe indirect Courſes never proſper'd; and, we now ſee the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Braganza,</hi> by this Means eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the <hi>Throne</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom quite rent from <hi>Spain,</hi> and the other <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces</hi> in the Hands of the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Grandees, ſenſible of the Male-adminiſtration of the Favourite <hi>Duke,</hi> grew diſguſted, with-drew from the <hi>Court,</hi> and from their Charges, leaving the King almoſt deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Attendants at home, or Officers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; yet, none durſt diſcover the Grounds of their Diſcontent, till the <hi>Conſtable</hi> of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile</hi>
                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:102956:170"/>broke the Ice, on the following Occaſion. This <hi>Conſtable,</hi> is one of the <hi>Prime Nobility</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> deducing his <hi>Pedigree</hi> from a <hi>Race</hi> of <hi>Kings.</hi> Him had <hi>Olivares</hi> made his Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Enemy, by propoſing a Match between a Son of his, and the <hi>Conſtable</hi>'s Daughter. This Son, whether Natural or only Adopted, is not certainly known; but, he had lived an obſcure and debauch'd Life, not ſo much as taken Notice of unleſs for his diſſolute Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and enormous Crimes, which had once expos'd him to the Sentence of Death, had he not met with better Fortune than he deſerv'd. All the <hi>Nobles</hi> were highly diſguſted, when they ſaw this Prodigal own'd by <hi>Olivares</hi> for his Natural Son and Heir, inveſted with the higheſt Dignities of the Kingdom, and made Maſter of prodigious Riches; eſpecially, ſince he was no Ways worthy of ſuch Preferment, retaining ſtill his former Vices, and giving e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where Proofs of an abject and baſe <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi> To ſee ſuch an one made <hi>Preſident</hi> of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and at the Height of Honour, in a fair Way to ſucceed the <hi>Duke</hi> in his <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,</hi> irritated the whole <hi>Court,</hi> and drove the <hi>Conſtable</hi> of <hi>Caſtile</hi> to Impatience. He utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſes the Match, diſdaining that his Daughter ſhould be linked to ſuch an Upſtart. He remonſtrates to the King, the exorbitant Ambition of <hi>Olivares.</hi> In fine, being ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by other <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> and by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the <hi>German Emperour,</hi> he ſo far prevailed on the King, that his Eyes began to be opened, and he now clearly ſaw, that
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:102956:170"/>all the Diſorders of the Government, ow'd their Origin to the ill Conduct of <hi>Olivares.</hi> Wherefore, taking the Advice of his faithful Counſellors, he baniſh'd him the <hi>Court,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd him of all Authority, confin'd him firſt to a Place not far from <hi>Madrid,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to <hi>Thoro,</hi> a City in <hi>Old Caſtile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus fell that great <hi>Miniſter,</hi> through his own Ambition to riſe. Seeking by unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Methods to ſecure his Maſter's Favour, he incurr'd the Height of his Diſpleaſure, and brought upon his own Head, an irrecoverable Diſgrace and Ruine.</p>
                  <p>I ſend thee this Example, as a Teſtimony of my Friendſhip and Fidelity; and, that thou mayſt inform the <hi>Divan,</hi> of the true Grounds of this Man's Misfortune. The King has now taken the Reins of Government into his own Hands, though, 'tis thought, too late.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh thee an Encreaſe of Vertues and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and that thy Moderation may keep thee ſtedfaſt in the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Favour.</p>

                  <p>IT is, thou knoweſt, a conſiderable Time ſince I was Love-ſmitten with the Beautiful <hi>Daria,</hi> who was Fair as an Angel, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet above any Mortal Creature. It's hard to ſay, whether the Beauty of her Mind or that of her Body, ſtruck deepeſt Impreſſions on my Soul. How long were the Nights and how ſhort my Slumbers, and what a general Diſtraction of Thoughts were I in? I could not abide my Chamber, and when I went out, no other Place could pleaſe me. I knew not what I ſaid or thought, whether I dreamt or was really awake, ſtood or ſate, went back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or forwards, all Poſtures and Places being alike, ſeeing none of them could afford me the Relief I ſought after.</p>
                  <p>I imagin'd no leſs, but that I muſt thus lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh on; yet I find, That Time and Abſence have, at length, made Way for Reaſon. Marvel not, dear <hi>Oglou,</hi> I have ſuffered theſe Tranſports. Our Paſſions are not in our Power; we cannot love and hate when and whom we pleaſe. There is a Conformity of Blood, wherein the Stars, they ſay, work Wonders. It's true, no Man can love and be wiſe at the ſame Time; but, prithee tell me, didſt ever know any Wiſe Man, who was not one Time or other in Love? Remember thine own Paſſion for the ſame Object, which will make thee the eaſier
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:102956:171"/>to excuſe mine. I'll tell thee a Story, which I have ſome-where read; which, if it does not palliate, yet will not aggravate my Weakneſs.</p>
                  <p>A certain Country-Man having loſt his <hi>Aſs,</hi> came to the <hi>Muezin,</hi> or <hi>Cryer,</hi> deſiring him to give Notice at the Door of one of their <hi>Moſques:</hi> which he did for Three ſeveral <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivals.</hi> But, no News being heard of the Animal, the Owner urged the <hi>Muezin</hi> to continue his <hi>Proclamations,</hi> with the Reward of a fat Pig to the Finder. The <hi>Muezin</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an arch Wag, and tired with the Fellow's Importunity, one Day when the Ceremonies of their <hi>Superſtitious</hi> Worſhip was ended, and People flockt amain out of the <hi>Moſque,</hi> he made this following <hi>Proclamation: If there be any Man here amongſt you, who will come forth, and ſolemnly profeſs, he never was in Love, he ſhall have a fat Pig.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An ungainly loobily Fellow, who was lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liſtning on his Staff, bawled out, <hi>That he could ſafely take his Oath, he was the Perſon who had never been in Love.</hi> Whereupon the <hi>Muezin</hi> taking him by the Sleeve, preſents him to the Country-Man, ſaying, <hi>Here, Friend, I have found your</hi> Aſs, <hi>the</hi> Pig <hi>is mine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Rejoyce with me for the Recovery of my Liberty, and believe an experienced Man, when he tells thee, that a Man's Love to his Friend, though it be not ſo violent and ſtrong as that to his Miſtriſs, yet is more ſolid and laſting.</p>

                     <hi>To the</hi> Invincible Vizir Azem, <hi>at the</hi> Port.</head>
                  <p>SInce thou, who art the Center and Source of all dignity, haſt drawn back one Ray of Honour into thy Self, whoſe Emanation before made ſome of thy Slaves Illuſtrious, with the Title and Power of <hi>Captain Baſſa:</hi> Since thou thy ſelf, I ſay, who art always <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraliſſimo</hi> by <hi>Land,</hi> vouchſafeſt alſo at this Juncture to become <hi>Baſſa</hi> of the Sea; I wiſh that both Elements may prove propitious to thee, and <hi>Fate</hi> crown thy Arms with the Height of Succeſs. May the <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> proclaim a <hi>Neſiraum</hi> where-ever thou ſaileſt, and may the <hi>Winds</hi> pay Homage to the Banner of the <hi>Ottoman Empire.</hi> In a Word, may yielding Waves and timely Gales, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey thee ſafe and proſperous to <hi>Venice;</hi> and, may <hi>Fortune</hi> always attend that Courage, which never forſook thee when thy Maſter's Honour lay at Stake.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>Oſmans,</hi> is highly obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to <hi>Providence,</hi> for ſuch a Valiant and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Leader of their Armies. There is need of the Reſolution of <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> to encounter with all the Formidable Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Hazards of this War. Thou art not marching againſt the ſoft and effeminate <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi>
                     <pb n="309" facs="tcp:102956:172"/>Men drown'd in the Luxurious Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and enervated by continual Voluptuouſneſs: But, thou muſt combat with the fierce <hi>Raſcians,</hi> hardy <hi>Servians,</hi> the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Inhabitants of <hi>Dalmatia</hi> and <hi>Iſtria,</hi> Men inur'd to Toils and Fatigues, and ſteel'd in Blood and Slaughter. I tell thee, there is no <hi>State</hi> in the World, that takes more Care to breed her Subjects up in all the Diſcipline of War, than this <hi>Republick.</hi> Thou haſt heard of the famous <hi>Arſenal</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> wilt thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what <hi>Adonai</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> has told me, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that Nurſery of War? He is newly come from thence, and ſays, That this <hi>Arſenal</hi> alone is half a League in Circuit; that there is but one Gate and Channel into it, by which their Veſſels paſs in and out; That in this Place, as in a Seminary, are bred up an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Number of Slaves, who are a little Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth by themſelves. Some of theſe are employ'd all the Year round, in making Gallies, Galliaſſes, Pinnaces, Brigantines and other Shipping, with all Materials belonging to them, as Maſts, Oars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Others make Bullets, Chains, Anchors, Cannon, and all kinds of Artillery. A Third ſort, are buſied in making Ropes, Sails, Shrouds, and ſuch like <hi>Naval</hi> Implements.</p>
                  <p>He ſays moreover, that in this Magazine are contain'd 40000 Piſtols; 200000 Daggers; 60000 Partizans; Javelins 100000; Croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bows 30000; Long-bows 50000; with 500000 Swords; Muſquets 200000; 1000 Cannon; as many Sacres; 500 Culverins. All theſe are
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:102956:173"/>preſerv'd as a Treaſury of War, beſides Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Quantities of all Manner of Weapons and Ammunition, which are daily carried from hence, to furniſh their Ships by Sea, and their Armies and Forts by Land. Thou wilt conclude from hence, That this is a Wiſe and Martial Nation, and that the Conqueſt of <hi>Venice</hi> will coſt much Sweat and Blood.</p>
                  <p>Wilt thou hear what this <hi>Jew</hi> ſays of their Publick Buildings, which are all made of the beſt Marble? He counts Sixty ſix Pariſh-Churches; Fifty two Monaſteries; Twenty ſix Nunneries; Eighteen Chapels; Seventeen Hoſpitals; and Six Schools. He numbers Fifty ſix Courts of Juſtice. Ten Gates of Braſs; Four hundred and fifty Stone-Bridges; Eighty Thouſand Boats, which cannot be ſerved with leſs than double that number of Water-men. The Inhabitants of this City are computed to be 800000. By all this, thou mayſt comprehend the Greatneſs and Wealth of this <hi>Republick,</hi> and that it is no Inglorious Enterprize to carry on a War againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Infidels,</hi> give Publick Toleration to <hi>Harlots;</hi> which is practiſed not only in this City, but all over <hi>Italy,</hi> and brings a vaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue into the Treaſury. The <hi>Whores-pence</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> is ſaid to amount Yearly to 100000 Zechins.</p>
                  <p>The Multitude of <hi>Jews</hi> alſo, does mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enrich that City, who have no leſs than Nine <hi>Synagogues</hi> there. They are Maſters of Infinite Wealth, and engroſs the greateſt Part of the <hi>Levantine</hi> Traffick, whereby <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi>
                     <pb n="311" facs="tcp:102956:173"/>is become ſuperlatively Wealthy, and has required the Epithete of <hi>Rich.</hi> This is grown a Faſhion in <hi>Italy,</hi> That every City has its peculiar Title, as <hi>Rome</hi> the <hi>Holy, Padua</hi> the <hi>Learned, Milan</hi> the <hi>Great, Naples</hi> the <hi>Proud,</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi> the <hi>Rich.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One Thing extremely pleaſes me, and had it not a ſhew of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> I could not but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud it, as an Argument of the Generoſity of this <hi>State. Adonai</hi> tells me, That there are no leſs than 165 Marble, and 23 Brazen Statues, erected by the Order, and at the Charges of this <hi>Republick,</hi> in Honour of the like Number of Valiant Soldiers, who have merited well of the Publick. This is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious Encouragement to Others, a Spur to Vertue, the Cheriſher of Martial Ardor. And <hi>Venice</hi> herein ſeems to imitate the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of <hi>Ancient Rome,</hi> which never ſpared any Coſt, to honour her <hi>Heroes,</hi> and render their Memory <hi>Immortal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God</hi> grant thee Victory over theſe <hi>Infidels,</hi> that at thy Return, laden with the <hi>Venetian</hi> Spoils, thou mayſt rejoice in the Royal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes and Favour of our Glorious <hi>Sultan;</hi> and, that not only <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but all the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman Empire,</hi> may celebrate Triumphs for the Succeſs of thy Arms.</p>

                     <hi>To</hi> Dgnet Oglou.</head>
                  <p>IT appears by thy melancholy Letter, thou haſt not forgot the Loſs thou formerly ſuſtainedſt by Fire, but ſtill continueſt to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb thy ſelf, with diſmal Apprehenſions of ſpending thy Days in ignominious Poverty. I am afraid, thou didſt ſet thy Heart too much on thy Wealth, which makes thee ſo uneaſy under thy Misfortune. Perhaps, thy Money was thy Maſter, and <hi>God</hi> in removing it from thee, has made thee free, and thereby fitted thee for the <hi>Contemplation</hi> of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Never fear Want; the ſame <hi>Providence</hi> which took Care of thee before thou cameſt into the World, will never be wanting to thee now thou art in it. It is but a Little that we need, and it will not be long before it will be impoſſible for us to want any Thing. Poverty never meets the thinking and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious. And a Man may ſatisfy <hi>Nature,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Obligation to <hi>Fortune;</hi> who, when ſhe ſeems moſt angry with us, ſcarce ever denies us Neceſſaries. The Belly, indeed, is a troubleſome Creditor, yet is quieted with a Little. <hi>Seneca</hi> tells us, That <hi>Epicurus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined himſelf to a narrower Allowance, than that of the ſevereſt Priſons, to the moſt hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Offender; and, found himſelf at Eaſe
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:102956:174"/>too in a ſtricter Diet, than any Man in the worſt Condition needs to fear. But the Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it is, we are governed in all Things by Opinion, and every Thing is to us as we think it to be.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Great Man tells us, of one <hi>Apici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> who poiſon'd himſelf for fear of ſtarving, when he had Two Hundred and Fifty <hi>Piaſters</hi> in his Coffers. And, another more <hi>Modern Philoſopher</hi> relates, That a rich Man, an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of his, falling mad, ſnatcht up a Straw, and complained he muſt periſh with Hunger, for he ſaw there was no Grain in the Empty Husks.</p>
                  <p>It's ſaid of the <hi>Emperor Galba,</hi> That he was wont to weep, when he ſaw his Table better covered than ordinary. And, I have read of a certain <hi>Chriſtian Mufti,</hi> who was ſo wretchedly covetous, that he would ſteal privately into the Great <hi>Moſque</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and put out the Lamps there to ſave Charges.</p>
                  <p>But methinks, I hear thee murmuring me an Anſwer, That this was never thy Humour, and theſe Citations make little Impreſſion on a Man, that has had his Houſe and Goods burnt, and narrowly eſcaped in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>Shall I tell thee then, what hap'ned lately in theſe Parts, which will, perhaps, make thee more contented and thankful for thy Life, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was theſe poor Peoples Lot, might have been thine.</p>
                  <p>Certain conſiderable Merchants coming to this Town, and Lodging at an Inn, not far
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:102956:175"/>from my Quarters, the Houſe being full of Gueſts, they were forced to be content with an upper Room; where, entertaining one another with pleaſant Diſcourſe, to paſs away the Time till Supper, on a ſudden the Kitchin was all in a Flame, unfortunately encreaſed with combuſtible Matter lying near the Chimney. Some ſay, there was great Quantity of Oil and Gun-Powder (an odd Store-Houſe to lay ſuch Commodities in.) However, the Fire appeared ſo ſuddenly and violently, that in a Moment all the Floor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, was ſeiz'd with it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Gentlemen, who were Two Stories high, in a Chamber towards the Street; as ſoon as they heard the Cry of Fire, began to make towards their Trunks and Port-mantles, which were lock'd up in a large Coffer, the Key of which hung at their <hi>Hoſteſs</hi>'s Girdle. They were for going down to fetch it, but the Fire had, in a Manner, conſum'd all beneath them. Whilſt they were buſied in trying to break open the Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and to take out every Man his own, their Chamber became inſtantly ſo full of Smoak, as was like to Choak them. They could neither ſave themſelves by going up or down, the Houſe being all over in a Flame. Moreover, their Neighbours ſeeing their own Houſes in Danger, were ſo concerned for themſelves, that they had no time to Pity Others. So that, few People attempted to ſuccour theſe poor <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> who, on their ſide, endeavoured with great Pieces of Wood,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:102956:175"/>to force a Paſſage; but the Walls and Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows were too Strong to give Way to their Efforts, being ſecur'd with thick Iron Barrs, faſtned in the Stones. In this lamentable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, having this inexorable Flame before their Eyes, which had already ſeized on the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, tearing the Hair off their Heads, and ſtamping on the Ground, they ſent forth ſuch dreadful Skrieks, as moved all that heard them to extream Compaſſion.</p>
                  <p>They threw their Gold and Silver into the Streets, in vain crying for Help; the Fire being ſo encreas'd, that before the People could bring Ladders and other Inſtruments to break a Way into the Chamber, theſe poor Wretches miſerably periſhed in the Flames.</p>
                  <p>Thank <hi>God</hi> thou haſt ſtill thy Life and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Turn theſe laſt the Right Way, and thou wilt find thou haſt loſt Nothing.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>Spaniards,</hi> are the Proudeſt Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the World. They ſtrut like Cranes, as they go along the Streets, and Walk by Rules of <hi>Geometry.</hi> Here are many of them in this City, ſince the Revolt of <hi>Catalonia</hi> and <hi>Rouſſilion.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> accuſe them of Uncomplaiſance and ill Manners, in that they will not change their Habit or Gate, in a Country ſo averſe from Formality.</p>
                  <p>They are extremely addicted to <hi>Rhodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montado's;</hi> as thou wilt eaſily gueſs by this which follows: <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. asking a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Officer, who was a Priſoner of War, Why the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> went not in Perſon to the Wars, as the Kings of <hi>France:</hi> He Anſwer'd, <hi>If the King, my Maſter, ſhould lead his own Army into the Field, the whole Earth would tremble</hi> under him.</p>
                  <p>Another being ask'd; Why the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King in his Style, boaſted, <hi>That the Sun was his Helmet,</hi> replyed, <hi>Becauſe that</hi> Luminary <hi>never ſets on all my Maſter's Territories.</hi> But the <hi>French-man</hi> wittily retorted, <hi>He will neither ſet, nor riſe on any of your Maſter's Dominions e'er long, if the</hi> Great Lewis <hi>goes on with his Conqueſts.</hi>

                  <p>THOU haſt already in the <hi>Divan,</hi> heard of the preſent Convulſions of the <hi>Engliſh State.</hi> I communicated to the <hi>Vizir Azem,</hi> what Intelligences I had received of the <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> of that <hi>Kingdom.</hi> Beſides, the <hi>Imperial City</hi> is full of Strangers of all Nations, who maintain Correſpondences with their ſeveral reſpective Countries: Whence it comes to paſs, That whatſoever is done in the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Corners of the Earth, is ſoon known to the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Sublime Port,</hi> which is the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> of the <hi>Whole World.</hi> But, I ſhall gratifie thee, in unveiling the Interiour of thoſe Events, which have made ſuch a Noiſe. Thou art naturally curious in thy Reſearches; and, I ſhall preſent thee with ſome additional Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, which I have made on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Affairs, ſince I wrote to the <hi>Supreme Miniſter</hi> on that Subject.</p>
                  <p>I acquainted him, that the late <hi>Cardinal Richlieu,</hi> had a hand in Embroiling that <hi>Iſland,</hi> as he had in exciting the <hi>Tumults</hi> of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and promoting the <hi>Revolution</hi> of <hi>Portugal.</hi> The part which he acted, was by Proxy. He had his Agents there, to blow up into a Flame, the Sparks which lay ſmothering in the Breaſts of that Diſcontented People. Thoſe of the <hi>Latin Church,</hi> reflect it as a Judgment on the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:102956:177"/>
                     <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, that they have never been free from Conſpiracies, Seditions and Rebellions, ſince the Time they ſhook off their Obedience to the <hi>Roman Mufti;</hi> which was, in the Days of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. As if, that Revolt in Point of Religion, had been the Source of all the following Tumults and Diſorders in the <hi>State.</hi> 'Tis certain, <hi>Religion</hi> has great Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on Mens Morals, and where a Liberty of innovating is once allow'd, it makes conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Progreſſions. Some <hi>French Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> ſay, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> embrac'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion for the Space of Seven Hundred Years; and, that during ſo long a Time, they never had any <hi>Civil Wars,</hi> but ſuch as were made on the Account of Succeſſion to the <hi>Crown.</hi> But, that after they had chang'd their <hi>Faith,</hi> they were always reſtleſs, ſtill hatching ſome Alteration in the <hi>Government.</hi> I know not how far theſe Obſervations are juſtifiable, Men being generally partial to their own Cauſe. But, the preſent Stirs in that <hi>Iſland,</hi> ſeem to owe their Increaſe, if not their Birth, to the Latitude which the Subjects take in Matters of <hi>Conſcience.</hi> Whilſt every Man, carves out to himſelf ſuch a <hi>Religion,</hi> as beſt pleaſes him; without being accountable to the <hi>State,</hi> or paying any <hi>Tribute,</hi> as is the Practice of the <hi>Ottoman Empire.</hi> Hence, it is few Mens Ambition, to conform to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> of the <hi>Prince;</hi> but, every <hi>Sect</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to perſwade both Prince and People, to ſubſcribe to their Sentiments; and, the moſt potent Party, threatens all the Reſt with
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:102956:178"/>the ill Conſequences of War, in Caſe their <hi>Tenets</hi> be not eſtabliſh'd. Among all the <hi>Religions</hi> which divide the Inhabitants of that <hi>Iſland,</hi> there is none for which they have ſo general an Averſion, as that which they call the <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> though it were once the <hi>Eſtabliſh'd Religion</hi> of the Country. This is now become the publick Eye-ſore; and, the reſt of the <hi>Sects,</hi> though they are at immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Difference with each other, yet all join Heart and Hand to oppoſe this Common Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear. The <hi>French</hi> ſay, That the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are like the <hi>Engliſh Maſtiffs,</hi> Two of which, I remember, were preſented to <hi>Sultan Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath,</hi> by the <hi>French Ambaſſador,</hi> with this Character of them, <hi>That though when they quarrell'd they would fight with each other to Death, yet ſhould a Bear be let looſe upon them, in the Midſt and Heat of their Fury, they would ſoon become Friends, and turn the Battel upon their Savage Enemy.</hi> Such, they ſay, is the Humour of the <hi>Engliſh Sectaries;</hi> and, the Factious have improved it ſo far, as to faſten the <hi>Odium</hi> of the Vulgar on the King himſelf, by ſuggeſting, That he deſigns to introduce the <hi>Roman Religion</hi> into that Country; whereas, according to the Relation of Travellers and knowing Men, he is a zealous <hi>Proteſtant.</hi> This is the Pretence of taking up Arms againſt him: An Artifice, by which <hi>Rebellion</hi> is generally uſher'd in; whilſt the Defence of <hi>Religion,</hi> is made a Cloak for <hi>Sacrilege</hi> and <hi>Treaſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Infidels</hi> have found out a Way to divide a Man from himſelf, by <hi>Metaphyſical</hi>
                     <pb n="321" facs="tcp:102956:178"/>Niceties, a <hi>Science</hi> wherein the <hi>True Believers</hi> are happily ignorant. They are actually in Arms againſt their <hi>Sovereign,</hi> yet they declare they fight for him: Maintaining their <hi>Rebellion</hi> by this <hi>Sophiſtry, That they fight againſt his</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>Perſon, to defend his</hi> Political; as if they could ſeparate one from the other. Some thinking Men ſay, 'tis well if they do not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce his <hi>Soul</hi> from his <hi>Body</hi> by the Help of theſe Juggling Diſtinctions.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Viceroy</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> has already loſt his Head, for no other Crime, but his Loyalty to his Maſter, who is blam'd for giving Conſent to the Execution of ſo faithful a <hi>Miniſter.</hi> Yet, the Curious pretend to trace the Footſteps of <hi>Juſtice</hi> in this Man's Deſtiny, ſince he fell a Sacrifice to the fame <hi>Democratick</hi> Principles, whereof he had formerly been a zealous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, having been obſerved to be once a great Oppoſer of the <hi>Royal Prerogative.</hi> If this be true, it ſeems as if <hi>Nemeſis</hi> her ſelf had brought him to his Puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt wonder at the Preſumption of theſe People, in diveſting the King of the <hi>Military</hi> Power by Sea and Land, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it themſelves.

                  <p>Before I conclude this Letter, I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to Thee a Paſſage, which happen'd in this King's Infancy, worthy of Remark: In former Ages, there were a Sort of <hi>Philoſophers</hi> or <hi>Prophets</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> whom they call'd <hi>Druids,</hi> and <hi>Bards.</hi> Theſe inſtructed the People in the <hi>Belief</hi> of a <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> and other <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religion.</hi> They foretold Things to come, and had acquir'd ſo great a Reputation, that the Kings of that Country would undertake no Affair of Moment, till they had firſt conſulted theſe <hi>Oracles.</hi> 'Tis ſaid, there are yet living ſome of that <hi>Prophetick</hi> Race in the Mountains of <hi>Scotland.</hi> One of which, a Man of great Sanctity and Wiſdom, being an Hundred and Twenty Years old, came to viſit this King's Father; at which Time he ſaw this King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then an Infant in his Nurſes Arms, whilſt his Elder Brother and Heir of the <hi>Crown</hi> ſtood by. The Old Man, after his Complements to the Father, takes the Infant Prince in his Arms, and beſtows his Benediction on it, in theſe Terms, <hi>Hail, Royal Babe, Heir of Two</hi> Crowns; <hi>thou ſhalt Reign a long Time</hi> happily; <hi>but in the End, a</hi> Flower-de-luce <hi>ſhall be thy Bane.</hi> The <hi>Nobles</hi> that were preſent, thinking that the Extremity of Age had bereav'd him of his Reaſon, were ready to thruſt him away; offering to take the Child from Him, and telling Him, <hi>That he miſtook; for, this was not the</hi> Heir <hi>of the</hi> Crown, <hi>but his</hi> Brother <hi>who ſtood by.</hi> But he, with a compoſed Look and an aſſured Carriage, made Anſwer, <hi>That
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:102956:180"/>what he ſpoke, was Truth;</hi> adding withal, <hi>That the Elder Brother ſhould die before his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and, That this ſhould live to inherit the</hi> Kingdoms <hi>of</hi> Scotland <hi>and</hi> England. The Event has made good ſome Part of his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy;</hi> for, his Elder Brother dyed at Twelve Years of Age, and he at this Day poſſeſſes thoſe Two Kingdoms; but, how <hi>the</hi> Flower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de-luce <hi>ſhall be his Bane,</hi> Time muſt evince. It is thought, That by it is meant, the <hi>French</hi> King; becauſe that is the <hi>Arms</hi> of the <hi>Royal Blood</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> It is hard to determine of future Events; yet there are ſome, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Influence which this <hi>Court</hi> has had on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commotions, and how far <hi>Cardinal Richlieu</hi> had engaged King <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. in Revenging the Affronts which were given to his Siſter the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> by that Inhoſpitable Nation, make no Difficulty of interpreting this <hi>Prophecy;</hi> but conclude, That the Unfortunate King of <hi>England,</hi> will at length fall a <hi>Victim</hi> to the <hi>French Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> though his own <hi>Subjects</hi> be Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to his Ruin.</p>
                  <p>I will continue my Intelligence of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Affairs, as I receive them.

                  <p>HERE are to be met with in theſe <hi>Weſtern Parts,</hi> infinite Numbers of People, who not only deſpiſe and vilifie <hi>our Law,</hi> but <hi>their own,</hi> and openly ſcoff at all <hi>Religions</hi> in the World. Theſe are known by the Name of <hi>Libertines</hi> or <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> which is to ſay, People that profeſs themſelves Enemies to the Belief of a <hi>God.</hi> A lewd and unthinking Herd of Animals, who dare not be alone, leſt they ſhould come to the Remembrance of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and be Wiſer.</p>
                  <p>Theſe People are in ſome ſort, like <hi>Ninus</hi> that great <hi>Aſſyrian Monarch,</hi> who vaunted, He never ſaw the Stars, nor deſired it; Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipp'd neither Sun nor Moon, never ſpoke to his People, nor took any Account of them, but was valiant in Eating and Drinking.</p>
                  <p>He was ſaid to have this Inſcription on his Tomb:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I WAS FORMERLY</hi> NINUS, <hi>THE</hi> GREAT LORD <hi>OF THE</hi> WORLD, <hi>AND LIVED AS THO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> DOST, B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T AM NOW NOTHING B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ST. ALL THE MEAT I HAVE EATEN, ALL THE HANDSOM
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:102956:181"/>WOMEN I HA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E ENJOY'D, ALL THE WORSHIP THAT WAS PAID ME, AND ALL THE RICHES I WAS POSSESS'D OF, HAVE FAIL'D ME; AND WHEN I SET FOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WARD FROM THIS</hi> WORLD <hi>INTO THE</hi> INVISIBLE STATE, <hi>I HAD NEITHER GOLD, NOR HORSE, NOR CHARIOT.

                  </p>
                  <p>Such another was <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> one of the Succeſſors of <hi>Ninus</hi> in that <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and in the Corruption of his Manners. An effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Prince, a Slave to his Luſts, and not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of an <hi>Imperial Crown.</hi> It was not to his Vertue or Courage that <hi>Nineveh</hi> was obliged, for ſuſtaining a Siege of Eight and Twenty <hi>Moons,</hi> but to the Impregnable Strength of her own Walls. For, ſo ſoon as he was told, that the <hi>Oracle</hi> was fulfill'd, and that the River <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi> was joyn'd in League with his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and had by an unuſual Flood, broke down a conſiderable Part of the Walls in which he truſted; all his Bravery vaniſh'd; he ſhew'd he was a Coward, and kill'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for fear of Death. Yet ſuch was the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Impotence of his Spirit, that even in this Way, he durſt not die alone; but, taking his Concubines and neareſt Attendants, with all his Gold and Jewels, he forced them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him into the Hollow of a Funeral Pile, which he fired with his own Hands,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:102956:181"/>and burnt his Servants with Himſelf. I do not eſteem it an Effect of Courage, to make Death a Sanctuary from the inevitable Miſeries of a hated Life. But, to be either willing to die, in the Height of humane Enjoyments, or to be reſolved to live and out-brave theſe very Calamities, which would tempt any Man to die, is the peculiar Mark of an Heroick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</p>
                  <p>However, thus died <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> having deſired, that a <hi>Monument</hi> might be erected to his Memory, with this Inſcription;</p>
                  <p>SARDANAPALUS <hi>LIV'D M<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CH IN A LITTLE TIME, HAVING ALWAYS GRATIFIED HIS SENSES: HE B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ILT TWO CITIES,</hi> ANCHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ALA <hi>AND</hi> TARSUS, <hi>IN ONE DAY; PERFORMED THE TASK OF MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NY YEARS, IN FO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R AND TWEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY HO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RS. ADVISES THEE, REA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER, TO IMITATE HIS EXAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLE; EAT, DRINK, AND ENJOY THY SELF; FOR AFTER DEATH, THERE IS NEITHER PLEAS<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RE NOR PAIN.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe were but <hi>Pigmies</hi> in <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> in Compariſon of others. <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> the <hi>Sicili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Monarch,</hi> was a <hi>Gyant</hi> in <hi>Infidelity.</hi> He not only committed <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> but, made it his Paſtime. He droll'd upon the <hi>Gods,</hi> while he robb'd their <hi>Temples;</hi> into which he never enter'd without a <hi>Jeſt,</hi> nor departed
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:102956:182"/>from their <hi>Altars</hi> without a <hi>Satyr.</hi> He put a <hi>Woollen Garment</hi> on the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>Jupiter O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympius,</hi> inſtead of the <hi>Golden Robe</hi> with which King <hi>Hiero</hi> had cloath'd it; and, excus'd the <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> by ſaying, <hi>Exchange was no Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery,</hi> and, <hi>That he conſulted the Eaſe and Health of the</hi> God, <hi>both for</hi> Summer <hi>and</hi> Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He play'd the <hi>Barber</hi> to the <hi>Statue</hi> of <hi>Aeſculapius;</hi> and, ſhav'd off his <hi>Golden Beard,</hi> ſaying, <hi>That ſince</hi> Apollo <hi>his</hi> Father <hi>was beard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, it was but good Manners for the</hi> Son <hi>to be ſo too.</hi> When he came into a Rich <hi>Temple</hi> in <hi>Syracuſa,</hi> and ſaw in the Hands of <hi>Mars,</hi> a Sword, whoſe Hilt was thick ſet with Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, Emeralds and Rubies, he made a mock-Obeiſance, and took the Sword from the extended Arm of the <hi>Image,</hi> ſaying, <hi>The</hi> God <hi>of</hi> War <hi>preſented him with that Sword, as an Earneſt of his future Victories,</hi> and, <hi>he ſhould be very ungrateful and impious, not to accept the Gift of the</hi> Deity. It was a naſty Affront which <hi>Nero</hi> put upon the <hi>Syrian Goddeſs,</hi> when he cauſed his Excrements to be thrown in her Face.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were Royal <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> and no Body durſt controul their Impious Pranks. The <hi>Libertines</hi> now a-days are more modeſt and politick. They dare not violate <hi>Temples,</hi> nor prophane the <hi>Altars</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> openly, but ſecretly they undermine all <hi>Religion,</hi> and diſpute People out of their <hi>Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some of theſe <hi>Atheiſts</hi> maintain the World to be Eternal. Others hold, that it came by a fortuitous Concourſe of Atoms; which,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:102956:182"/>after an Eternal Dance in an Infinite Space, at laſt jumbled together into that exquiſite Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der we now behold, and contemplate. They profeſs themſelves <hi>Diſciples</hi> of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> yet willfully corrupt the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of that Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous <hi>Philoſopher;</hi> who, though he taught, That the <hi>Supreme Felicity</hi> of Man conſiſted in <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> yet never meant that of the <hi>Body,</hi> but the purer Joys and Tranquillity of the <hi>Mind,</hi> ariſing from a Life lead according to <hi>Reaſon:</hi> Whereas, theſe <hi>Modern Epicureans,</hi> place their higheſt Contentment in the Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of their Senſual Appetites. A Jolly Crew, who number their Days by Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and reckon that Hour miſpent, wherein they have not drawn ſome Line of Voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. And, as if they had conſecrated Themſelves to <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> Women and Wine, divide the moſt important Actions of their whole Lives.</p>
                  <p>They are profeſſed Enemies to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> of Good and Evil <hi>Spirits,</hi> of the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Judgment,</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell.</hi> They eſteem <hi>Religion</hi> only as an Invention of <hi>Politicians,</hi> to reduce the World under ſome Form of Government; and ſpare not to call <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Son of <hi>Mary, Impoſtors,</hi> as well as <hi>Mahomet</hi> our <hi>Holy Lawgiver.</hi> They laugh at <hi>Miracles,</hi> and ridicule <hi>Prophecies;</hi> and, you had as good talk to them of a <hi>Man</hi> in the <hi>Moon,</hi> as of an <hi>Apparition</hi> from the <hi>Dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Sort of <hi>Libertines,</hi> are not only to be found in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> but in General
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:102956:183"/>all over <hi>Europe.</hi> The <hi>Contagion</hi> is <hi>Epidemick,</hi> the <hi>Infection</hi> has ſpread it ſelf through <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laity, Nobles</hi> and <hi>Vulgar;</hi> inſomuch, as he paſſes for a Man of no Wit, who has not a Spice of <hi>Atheiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This will not ſeem ſtrange when thou ſhalt know, that even among their <hi>Mufti's</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, there have been ſome <hi>Lucians;</hi> who eſteem'd <hi>Religion</hi> but an <hi>Old Wife's Tale,</hi> and us'd the moſt important <hi>Articles</hi> of their <hi>Faith,</hi> but as Inſtruments of Ambition and Avarice, to aggrandiſe themſelves and fill their Coffers. <hi>Leo</hi> X. a famous <hi>Roman Pontiff,</hi> will be record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all Poſterity, for that <hi>Sarcaſm</hi> of his on <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Meſſias</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtians; How much are we enriched, by this</hi> Fable <hi>of</hi> Chriſt? Indeed, if we reflect well on the <hi>Maxims</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> of that <hi>Court,</hi> it will not be hard to conclude, That <hi>Gold</hi> is the <hi>Great God</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltimate Object</hi> of their <hi>Adoration,</hi> ſince that alone can open or ſhut <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell;</hi> no Piety or Vertue, no Prayers or Tears, Alms or Penances being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable, unleſs made ſo by the meritorious Adjunct of this powerful Metal. Neither need the moſt enormous Sinners deſpair of Pardon, if they have but <hi>Pluto</hi> for their <hi>Proctor,</hi> and <hi>Gold</hi> for their <hi>Apology;</hi> there being certain <hi>Rates</hi> ſet upon all <hi>Sins,</hi> which if paid, thoſe of the deepeſt Dye are as readily abſolv'd, as the ſmalleſt <hi>Peccadillo's.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Spiritual Merchandiſe of Souls in the <hi>Supreme Court</hi> of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> has in no ſmall Degree contributed to the <hi>Atheiſm</hi> of the Age.
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:102956:183"/>While Religion is thereby render'd Cheap and Vile, a mere Artifice of Government, a Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem of the <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> to keep Fools in Awe and Subjection. And therefore, ſuch as have a better Opinion of themſelves, and would be thought Men of Senſe, take Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to carp at the very Fundamental Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of all Religion, and to diſpute againſt the <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>God.</hi> Rather than tamely couch under the Luggage of manifeſt Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, they like wild Colts, throw off the Yoke even of natural Religion and common Morality: And, becauſe they have too much <hi>Senſe</hi> to be abus'd with <hi>Religious <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrages,</hi> and too little <hi>Faith</hi> to ſwallow all the <hi>Pious Frauds</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> for undoubted <hi>Oracles</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> they will have no <hi>Faith</hi> at all, nor give any Credit to the Dictates of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Reaſon; but, turning <hi>Scepticks</hi> in all Things, are ſtedfaſt to Nothing but the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of their Luſts; looking upon it as ill Husbandry of the preſent Time, to ſquander away the leaſt Moment on the Thoughts of a Future Life.</p>

Though I often think over thy Sentiments with infinite Delight, yet I will not repeat them here, leſt I tempt thee to throw away my Letter,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:102956:184"/>before thou haſt half read it. Only give me leave to put thee in mind, How thou didſt then vindicate the <hi>Infant</hi> World, for placing thoſe Excellent Souls in <hi>Heaven,</hi> who had been Illuſtrious Benefactors to Mankind on <hi>Earth:</hi> And, that though after-Ages fell into the Crime of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> by giving Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours to the firſt Inventors of Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and by ſacrificing to the <hi>Manes</hi> of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted <hi>Heroes;</hi> yet, it was thy Opinion that thoſe who firſt conſecrated them to <hi>Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> and a Fame that ſhould know no End, did but perform the Rights of Gratitude, exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Dictates of Innocent Nature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever dreaming of the Religious Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies which their deluded Poſterity ſuper-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd.</p>
                  <p>To do thee Juſtice, this was a Noble Thought, full of Humanity, and exactly ſquaring with unbyaſs'd Reaſon; and, I muſt confeſs, I owe the frequent Cure of my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, to the Force of this generous Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> eſpecially here in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> out-go the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Superſtitious Narrowneſs of their Principles; and, as the latter confined Salvation to the Lineage of <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſo the former reſtrain it to the <hi>Latin Church.</hi> I have often convers'd with ſome of their Learned <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes,</hi> on the Theme of the <hi>Pagans</hi> Salvation, but can by no Arguments beat them off from their inveterate Prejudice. They will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſo much as one of the <hi>Heathens</hi> to be ſaved, and but a Hundred and Forty Four Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:102956:185"/>of the <hi>Jews,</hi> accounting Twelve Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of every Tribe. This is the ſevere A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetick of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Religion, whoſe Profeſſors thereby render themſelves greater <hi>Infidels</hi> than thoſe they damn. 'Tis to be hop'd, there is a larger Calcule with <hi>God</hi> for the Number of the <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> or elſe one would think, <hi>Hell</hi> would be too populous, and the <hi>Devil</hi> would be forced to make frequent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimations, and ſend Colonies abroad, to make Room for the ever freſh Glut of his new Gueſts.</p>
                  <p>For my Part, who was Educated in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Rudiments of Truth, in the ſerene Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the <hi>Mahometan Faith,</hi> I believe, That there are ſome ſaved of all Religions, and that at the <hi>Day of Judgment,</hi> there ſhall be erected a <hi>Fourth Banner</hi> for ſuch to reſort to, who never heard of <hi>Moſes, Jeſus</hi> or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet.</hi> Aſſuredly, there is no Malice in the <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> and he will not Damn Men for their Involuntary Ignorance of his <hi>Revealed Laws,</hi> provided they live up to the genuine Dictates of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which are the trueſt Standards of Vertue and Poſitive Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have a <hi>Heaven</hi> for their <hi>Saints,</hi> and a <hi>Hell</hi> for <hi>Sinners;</hi> in this they agree with the <hi>Muſſulmans.</hi> They have a <hi>Limbo</hi> for <hi>Infants,</hi> that die unbaptized; and, <hi>another</hi> for the Vertuous <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who lived before the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> Their Charity had been complete, had they provided a <hi>Third,</hi> for Juſt and Vertuous Men of all Religions; whom it
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:102956:185"/>is too hard to damn on the Score of what they know not, ſo long as they unblameably pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe whatſoever Good they know. The <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of <hi>Priſons</hi> in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> ſeems to contain a more equal Diſtribution of Juſtice, when it aſſigns a <hi>Middle-Place,</hi> between <hi>Paradiſe</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> to thoſe who have led an indifferent Life, equally checquer'd with Vertue and Vice. They there ſhall behold the <hi>Joys</hi> of the <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> and the <hi>Torments</hi> of the <hi>Damned;</hi> yet ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taſte of the One, nor feel the Other; but paſs their Time in a tedious Neutrality, between the <hi>Height</hi> of <hi>Bliſs,</hi> and the <hi>Depth</hi> of <hi>Miſery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, what <hi>Muſſulman</hi> will queſtion the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> when the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Glory</hi> it ſelf tells us, That <hi>Alexander the Great</hi> was an <hi>Holy Prophet;</hi> and yet we know, he neither was of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor was he ſo much as Circumcis'd.</p>
                  <p>My Converſe with the Learned <hi>Derviſes</hi> in this City, has taught me ſome of their <hi>School-Diſtinctions;</hi> among which, they uſe a pretty one in the Damnation of Unbaptized Infants; teaching, That ſuch are damn'd to the <hi>Pain of Loſs,</hi> but not to the <hi>Pain of Senſe.</hi> I am apt to think, this Diſtinction may very well be adapted to the Caſe of many Men, who as their Vertues are not of that Heroick Stamp, as to carry them directly to <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are their Vices of ſo black a Tincture, as to ſink them immediately to <hi>Hell.</hi> I believe, there are Proportionate Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for all Sorts and Degrees of Vertue and
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:102956:186"/>Vice; and that the Souls of the Departed, are marſhall'd and diſpoſed in Receptacles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to their proper Rank and Quality. And, if I can but get to <hi>Virgil</hi>'s pleaſant Greens and ſhady Woods, the fortunate Manſions of Innocent and Juſt Men; I will not envy the <hi>Heroes,</hi> nor deſire to be canoniz'd among the <hi>Gods. Elyzium</hi> or <hi>Paradiſe</hi> are much One to me: I ſeek not the Name, but the Nature of <hi>Bliſs.</hi> Provided I may but gain a Place of Reſt and Refreſhment, and be admitted into agreeable Company, I will not complain, nor diſturb the Peace of the <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> with an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Queſt of the Higheſt Dignities in <hi>Heaven;</hi> as if a Man could not be Happy, unleſs he be made a <hi>Vizir</hi> of the <hi>Bench</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</p>
                  <p>Let thou and I, dear <hi>Egry,</hi> live in ſuch an exact Conformity of Manners here, that when we go hence, we may by the <hi>Divine Numen,</hi> be both diſpoſed in the ſame Apartment and Society, carry our Friendſhip along with us to that other World; and let us make a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, That whoſoever dies firſt, ſhall ſoon appear to the Surviver, and give a hirn true Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his State, if it be in the Power of the Dead to perform ſuch Bargains.</p>
                  <p>In the mean Time, I counſel thee to make much of this preſent Life; not by ſordid Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs and Vice, from which I know thy natural Averſion; but by borrowing from each Element, an Occaſion of improving thy Science and Vertue. This is the Way to be raiſed above the Elements, in which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

                  <p>IT is apparent, that the <hi>States</hi> of the World are void of Compaſſion, and that they are altogether actuated by a Principle of Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Monſieur la Tuillerie,</hi> Ambaſſador from <hi>France</hi> to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> arrived at that <hi>Court</hi> with ſpecious Pretexts of Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, promiſing to do his utmoſt to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the Differences between the Two <hi>Crowns</hi> of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Suedeland,</hi> will all poſſible Advantages to the former. But, when the Buſineſs came to the Tryal, when he ſaw King <hi>Chriſtian</hi> advancing into the Field a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> with an Army of near Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Thouſand Men, which in all likelihood would have given the <hi>Suedes</hi> occaſion to
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:102956:187"/>repent their raſh and unjuſt Incurſions; he charmed the good-natur'd old King, with ſuch fair Promiſes, and ſubtle Inſinuations, that he cauſed him to retreat at the Moment of giving Battel.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame Manner dealt <hi>Galaſſo</hi> with the King, who did but make a ſhow with his Forces, without doing any effectual Service. For, when he might have compelled the <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh General,</hi> either to Fight or Retire, he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him freely to paſs through <hi>Holſtein</hi> and return into <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Curious and Inquiſitive, lay the Blame of this Treachery on <hi>Cardinal Mazarini,</hi> whoſe Piſtols, they ſay, had corrupted <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſo,</hi> and made him run counter to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Inſtructions.</p>
                  <p>But, in my Opinion, this is an unjuſt Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> who was afterwards known to be Inſtrumental, in ſpurring on the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to compoſe theſe Quarrels: Which at laſt was accompliſh'd, by the dextrous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of this Great <hi>Miniſter.</hi>

                  <p>THE Wars of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Suedeland</hi> are the Principal Subject of Diſcourſe all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Europe;</hi> eſpecially in this <hi>Court,</hi> which has a great Intereſt in the good Succeſs of the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Arms; the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> being the moſt formidable Enemy, that <hi>France</hi> has in the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>General Torſtenſon</hi> marches about, like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Scanderbeg;</hi> Victorious where-ever he ſtrikes. 'Twas to his own Ruin, that <hi>Galaſſo</hi> ſuffer'd him to paſs quietly through <hi>Holſtein;</hi> when, in Conjunction with the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Army he was in a Condition to give him Battel, or compel him to retire.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner was <hi>Galaſſo</hi> ſeparated from the <hi>Danes,</hi> and Encamped near <hi>Magdeburgh;</hi> but, <hi>Torſtenſon</hi> began to obſerve his Motions, and lay down not far from him, between whom there paſſed many Skirmiſhes, which very much leſſen'd the <hi>German Army.</hi> Beſides, they were extremely incommoded for want of Proviſions; ſo, that at his return to <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> he could preſent the <hi>Emperour</hi> but with a few of his Men, and give but a ſhallow Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Loſs of the Reſt.</p>
                  <p>In the mean Time, <hi>Conningſmark</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penheim,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>German</hi> Affairs decline apace; and, the <hi>Suedes,</hi> who not long ago were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and ſcarce regarded, begin to make a conſiderable Figure in the World.</p>

                  <p>I Know not whether it be an Effect of the Stars, or the Sport of <hi>Spirits,</hi> that has happened here lately; whether it proceeds from <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Hell, Nature</hi> or <hi>Magick Art, Chance</hi> or <hi>Deſtiny;</hi> the Marks it has left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind are very Terrible, and the Aſtoniſhment is not yet off from the Peoples Hearts.</p>
                  <p>Three Days ago, I was riding from <hi>Paris</hi> to St. <hi>Germain en Lay,</hi> where the <hi>Court</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. When I was got about Half-Way on the Road, there aroſe a ſudden Blaſt of Wind, which ruſhing vehemently among the Trees, made an uncouth Noiſe, and ſtruck me with ſome Surprize and Horror: But, my Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſoon encreaſed, when I perceived the Hedges and Trees that grew along the Road ſide, torn up and carried away by an Inviſible Hand. I was afraid, my Horſe and I ſhould have been taken up for Company. For, this Whirlwind paſſed very near us, twiſting in all that was in its way; and, ſwiftly moving in a Circular Figure, it grew to ſuch a Bigneſs, by the continual Addition of Trees, Hedges, Stones, Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that it ſeemed like a flying Wood.</p>
                  <p>I tell thee, though I was not without ſome
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:102956:189"/>Apprehenſion of Danger, yet hitherto this was the pleaſanteſt and moſt diverting Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle that ever I ſaw in my Life. Trees are a very grateful Object on the Earth, but they are much more ſo in the Air; and, eſpecially at that Height and Diſtance, they affect the Eye with unſpeakable Delight. I was raviſhed to ſee a moving Foreſt, almoſt as high as the Clouds. The pendulous Gardens of <hi>Babylon,</hi> would have appear'd but a Trifle, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of his Noble Scene.</p>
                  <p>I followed it with my Eye as far as I could, till at length my Sight was intercepted by a thick Shower of Rain, which drove me into a Houſe for Shelter. Where, before I came away, I was informed, that what I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed ſo delightful, proved very Tragical to the Neighbouring Villages. Falling down from that Height I left it at, and ſcatterring its former Load, it fell violently into the Groves and Orchards, tearing up ſome Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Trees by the Roots, and carrying them away like Chaff in the Air, throwing down many Hundreds of Houſes, removing others from the Foundations, and doing the poor Husbandmen ſuch irreparable Damages, as the like has not been known in the Memory of Man.</p>
                  <p>Common Humanity, taught me to pity theſe <hi>Infidels;</hi> and, the Natural Principle of Self-preſervation, made me bleſs my ſelf, That I had eſcaped ſo imminent a Danger. But tell me, Thou who art converſant in the <hi>Secrets</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> who knoweſt the <hi>Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi>
                     <pb n="344" facs="tcp:102956:190"/>of the <hi>Stars,</hi> and the <hi>Hidden Force</hi> of the <hi>Elements,</hi> What is the Cauſe of theſe wild Fits and Convulſions of the Air? The Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious here ſay, the <hi>Devils</hi> are let looſe at ſuch a Time from their <hi>Infernal</hi> Priſons, to keep a <hi>Carnaval,</hi> and play their wanton Pranks in open Light, there being no <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi> in <hi>Hell.</hi> Others believe, <hi>Magicians</hi> are at Work; and, by the Force of Spells, raiſe Hurricanes and Storms. But, the Learned ſay, That theſe are only the Effects of <hi>Nature,</hi> proceeding from <hi>Meteors</hi> and <hi>Exhalations</hi> in the Air. I, for my Part, never puzzle my ſelf with a vain Search, after that which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be demonſtrated. If theſe <hi>Hurricanes</hi> be <hi>Natural,</hi> then 'tis certain, <hi>Nature</hi> does not diſcover her Power at all Times, nor in the conſtant <hi>Series</hi> of her Works; but, has her Reſerves, and Times of State, wherein ſhe diſplays her Self with greater Pageantry, to create Reſpect: Since the unthinking Part of Mankind, is ſooner taken with ſuch unuſual Events as make a Noiſe, than with the Antient ſtanding Miracles of the Creation, the ſilent and regular Motions, exquiſite Order, and never ceaſing Activity, of the Sun, Moon and Stars. Thus, we are never ſenſible of the Heat that is within us, or the Circulation of our Blood, becauſe we are always habituated to feel it from our <hi>Embryo.</hi>

                     <hi>To the</hi> Kaimacham.</head>
                  <p>I Need not Apologize for my long Silence. <hi>Eliachim</hi> aſſures me, he has acquainted <hi>Nathan Ben Saddi</hi> with the Occaſion of it, by whom the News of my Impriſonment might be tranſmitted to the <hi>Sublime Port.</hi> When I was firſt ſeized upon, I had not the Liberty to ſend for <hi>Eliachim,</hi> or ſee any Body that I deſired to ſpeak with. But, that honeſt <hi>Jew,</hi> ſoon heard the News, and writ to <hi>Vienna</hi> to prevent any <hi>Diſpatches</hi> that might come from thence, or from <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> He has now fully convinced me of his Fidelity, which I ſo long ſuſpected; and, I dare truſt him henceforward, with the moſt important Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of my <hi>Commiſſion.</hi> His Sagacity and Conduct in this Occurrence, is worthy of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment and Reward; having dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly blinded <hi>Cardinal Mazarini,</hi> who is an <hi>Argus:</hi> baffl'd his ſevereſt Scrutinies, and been highly Inſtrumental in procuring me the Liberty I now again enjoy.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arabian</hi> Proverb ſays, <hi>The</hi> Camel <hi>that Travels often to</hi> Meccha, <hi>will return Lame at laſt.</hi> I had for a long Time eſſayed, to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate into the Drifts of this <hi>Cardinal,</hi> as well as thoſe of his Predeceſſor <hi>Richlieu,</hi> yet found nothing but Riddles. One might as ſoon trace <hi>Arethuſa</hi> in her Wandrings under
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:102956:191"/>Ground, or purſue a Man in the Intricate Mazes of <hi>Daedalus,</hi> as diſcover the Intrigues of this <hi>State-Serpent.</hi> His Deſigns are a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Labyrinth.</hi> However, walking one Day in one of their <hi>Churches,</hi> I caſt my Eye on a Stone in the Pavement, juſt before the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> which by the perpetual kneeling of many Thouſand Votaries, was worn away half a Cubit. The Sight of this, made me conclude, That there is no Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo great, which by aſſiduous Induſtry, and conſtant Reſolution, may not be overcome. Chear'd with this Thought, I determin'd with my ſelf, never to faint, or give over my moſt ſtrenuous Endeavours, to unlock the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of this <hi>Great Miniſter,</hi> wherein I knew all the <hi>Secrets</hi> of <hi>Europe</hi> were laid up. I left no Stone unturn'd, to compaſs my Deſign. I haunted the <hi>Court</hi> daily, and follow'd the <hi>Cardinal</hi> like his Shadow. I inſinuated with his Followers and Creatures, Flatter'd the Soft and Ambitious, preſented Gifts to the Covetous; was Merry and Frank with ſome, Reſerv'd and Grave with others: In fine, I ſo aim'd to comport my ſelf with every One, that I might win All. At length, knowing that there was a private <hi>Agent</hi> from <hi>Prince Ragotski</hi> come to this <hi>Court,</hi> my Zeal for the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> ſuggeſted to me, That if I could wind my ſelf into this Man's Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I ſhould be able to unravel ſome <hi>great Secret,</hi> and do an Acceptable Service to the <hi>Ottoman Empire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Opportunities are ſeldom wanting to the
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:102956:192"/>Watchfull and Diligent. I had acquaintance enough at the <hi>Court.</hi> And appearing often in the Retinue of <hi>Mazarin;</hi> and, the <hi>Cardinal</hi> ſometimes ſingling me out, and Diſcourſing with me, in the Preſence of the <hi>Tranſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> this Stranger took more than ordinary Notice of me: Which gave me Occaſion to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs my ſelf to him, in Hopes to accompliſh my Purpoſe. But, <hi>Fate</hi> had otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed. The <hi>Agent</hi> remember'd my Face, and told me in the <hi>Sclavonian</hi> Tongue, That he had ſeen me in the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s <hi>Seraglio.</hi> It is not hard for thee, Illuſtrious <hi>Kaimacham,</hi> to conceive the Diſorder I was in at this Challenge. But, reſuming Courage, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>That it was poſſible he might have ſeen me there; for, I had formerly ſerved a</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Ambaſſador <hi>at the</hi> Ottoman Court, <hi>in Quality of</hi> Secretary. He ſeem'd ſatisfied with my Anſwer, diſſembling his farther Thoughts: But, as I afterwards perceiv'd, I owe my Confinement to this fatal Interview. No doubt, but he remarqu'd the particular Station I was in at the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> when he came thithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to Negotiate for <hi>Prince Ragot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ski,</hi> in <hi>Sultan Amurath</hi>'s Time. For, before I went to Bed that Night, I was ſent for to <hi>Cardinal Mazarin,</hi> and ſtrictly Examined about my Country, my Religion, my Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at <hi>Paris,</hi> and other Matters; and, was ſent away Priſoner to the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> (which was formerly a <hi>Citadel,</hi> erected to awe this Town, but not being found ſerviceable in that Kind, is ſince made a Priſon.) That which moſt
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:102956:192"/>puzzles me, is, That I was not confronted Face to Face, with this <hi>Tranſylvanian.</hi> My Confinement was very cloſe, being denyed the Uſe of Pen, Ink and Paper, and the Acceſs of any of my Friends. Indeed, I knew not what uſe to make of thoſe Materials, nor durſt I write to any Body, leſt I ſhould have brought them into the ſame Snare, and done my ſelf a greater Diſſervice. All my Comfort was, That I had left no Writings in my Lodgings, which could diſcover the Affairs of my <hi>Commiſſion.</hi> 'Tis true, when I was ſearch'd, they found the <hi>Alcoran</hi> in my Pocket, which gave a mighty Jealouſie to the <hi>Cardinal;</hi> but, I excuſed it by ſaying, I kept that Book, that I might not forget my <hi>Arabick;</hi> in which, the <hi>Cardinal</hi> knew I was well skill'd, having formerly ſeen a <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> which I made out of that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage for <hi>Cardinal Richlieu.</hi> Beſides, they found in my Chamber <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s <hi>Lives,</hi> the <hi>Annals</hi> of <hi>Tacitus; Livy</hi>'s <hi>Roman Hiſtory;</hi> a <hi>Philoſophical Treatiſe</hi> of <hi>Averroes,</hi> and a ſmall <hi>Tract</hi> of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> one of the <hi>Chriſtian Fathers:</hi> Which made it appear, as reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to conclude me a <hi>Pagan</hi> or a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> for having their Books by me, as a <hi>Turk</hi> for having the <hi>Alcoran.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſtill perſiſted, in aſſerting my ſelf to be <hi>Titus</hi> of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> and that I was a <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> (<hi>Heaven</hi> forgive the Perjury!) I had a <hi>Friar</hi> ſent to me, who exhorted me to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of my Sins, thinking this way to pump the <hi>Mighty Secret</hi> from me. But, this turn'd
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:102956:193"/>to my Advantage; for, calling to mind a Learned and Ingenuous <hi>Friar,</hi> with whom I had convers'd, and contracted ſome Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, I ſignified my Reſolution to confeſs my ſelf to him. This is a Privilege could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied me, it being lawful for every Man, to chuſe his own <hi>Confeſſor.</hi> The <hi>Friar</hi> was ſent for: And, this being the only time I was like to ſpeak to any of my Friends without Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, I improv'd the Advantage; and, to make my <hi>Confeſſion</hi> ſeem the more ſincere, I accuſed my ſelf of what I ne'er was guilty of, telling him with a well counterfeited Sorrow, That the true Reaſon of abandoning <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davia,</hi> was, becauſe I had murdered a near Kinſman there. My <hi>Confeſſion</hi> ended, and <hi>Abſolution</hi> granted, the <hi>Friar</hi> embraced me, and told me, That he would do me all the Service he could; in Order to my Releaſe. I expreſſed my Gratitude in the beſt Terms I could, and begged of him to viſit me often, ſince he was the only Perſon would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to do me that kind Office. I will not detain thee longer, Sage <hi>Baſſa,</hi> in Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Iſſue.</p>
                  <p>This honeſt <hi>Friar</hi> was as good as his Word. He was admitted to ſee me almoſt daily, without Suſpicion. I truſted him with <hi>Eliachim</hi>'s Acquaintance; which render'd him very Serviceable; for, he often brought me Money from the <hi>Jew,</hi> when he knew not how otherwiſe to convey it to me. In a word, between them both, they ſo wrought on the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> that after Six <hi>Moons</hi> Impriſonment,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:102956:193"/>I was releas'd, and am now in more Credit than before.</p>
                  <p>The Great <hi>God</hi> grant, that the Malice of the <hi>Infidels,</hi> may always turn to the Advantage of the <hi>True Believers;</hi> and that from their Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, occaſions may ariſe to promote the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the <hi>Ottoman Empire.</hi>

                  <p>AT length I am releas'd from a tedious Impriſonment, the Occaſion of which the <hi>Kaimacham</hi> will acquaint thee with. Had this happened in <hi>Spain,</hi> my Uſage had been much worſe. And, for this Reaſon, I eſteem <hi>France</hi> the Nobleſt and Freeſt Kingdom with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Pale</hi> of the <hi>Latin Church;</hi> that it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver would ſubmit to the <hi>Tyranny</hi> of the <hi>Inquiſition:</hi> Which is a kind of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Divan,</hi> or <hi>High Court</hi> of <hi>Judicature,</hi> where Crimes againſt the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> are try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It was firſt erected, at the Inſtance of one <hi>Dominick,</hi> who for this meritorious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, was afterwards canonized <hi>A Saint.</hi> The original Deſign of it was, to extirpate the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal.</hi> But now, 'tis made a Trap for all Strangers, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:102956:194"/>thoſe they call <hi>Hereticks.</hi> Whoſoever falls into it, is commonly fleec'd of his Eſtate, and not ſeldom chous'd out of his Life. For, the firſt Thing the <hi>Holy Fathers Inquiſitors</hi> do, is, to make a zealous and devout Inſpection into the Poſſeſſions of the Priſoner. If they find him Rich, that is ſufficient to make him Criminal; and, the <hi>good</hi> Fathers, will take a <hi>pious</hi> Care to diſpoſe of his Wealth. They have their Spies in all Companies, who inform them of Mens Words and Actions. Theſe Hounds, are always upon the Scent; and, will ſmell a <hi>Heretick</hi> out, if he breaths within the Purlieu of their Hunt. A Man dares not ſay, <hi>his Soul is his own</hi> in theſe Countries; nor, claim the Privilege to exerciſe his Reaſon. The Inhabitants live in a moſt abject Slavery to the <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> and Travellers muſt drag the Chain, bridle their Tongues, and curb their Actions for their own Security. But, in <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> is abhor'd; and, an Immortal Averſion conceived againſt the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and cruel Practices of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The People are of more generous Tempers, the Laws not ſo rigourous, and yet they come far ſhort of the Juſtice of the <hi>Ottoman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</hi> Though my Confinement was tedious, yet 'twas tolerable; and, if I could not be happy in a Priſon, ſo neither was I properly miſerable.</p>
                  <p>When Evil ſurpriſes us, we commonly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright our ſelves, by beholding it in its groſs Bulk; our ſcattered Spirits, are aſtoniſhed at an infinite Bugbear. Whereas, if we take a more
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:102956:194"/>particular Survey of the dreadful Object, ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomize and view it Piece by Piece; we find, that the greateſt part of what ſo diſmay'd us, had no other Exiſtence, than in our own Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. Thus, when I was firſt ſeized by <hi>Cardinal Mazarini</hi>'s Order, I preſaged to my ſelf no leſs than inſufferable Tortures, an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious Death, and (which affected me with the moſt ſenſible Grief) the Diſcovery of my <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> and the Affairs of the <hi>Sublime Port.</hi> When I firſt enter'd the Priſon, I bid adieu to all Joy and Comfort in <hi>This Life,</hi> and thought of Nothing but preparing my ſelf for that <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World,</hi> where I hope to be renewed again to immenſe Pleaſures, the Delights of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,</hi> as a Reward of my Sufferings for that <hi>Law,</hi> which was brought down from <hi>Heaven</hi> by the <hi>Angel Gabriel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe were my firſt Thoughts in Priſon; but, when Sleep had compoſed my Spirits, and Time had render'd me more familiar with the Place of my Reſtraint, I began to think, it was not impoſſible to live, and even to regain my Liberty. However, I reſolved to alleviate the Grief of my Reſtraint, by contracting my Deſires within a narrower Compaſs, and circumſcribing my Wiſhes within thoſe Walls which confined my Body. I framed to my ſelf Felicities, out of the Contemplation of my Miſery; and, by conſidering what I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, I pacified my Diſcontent for what I wanted. I was not ſo cloſe ſhut up, but that I could at Pleaſure let in freſh Air, and take a Proſpect of the City and adjacent Fields, at
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:102956:195"/>my Window. This made me reliſh my Priſon with ſome Degree of Content. The Want which moſt afflicted me, was, that of Fountain Water; which, I durſt not ſo much as ask for, in ſuch Quantities as are requiſite to the Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a <hi>Muſſulman,</hi> leſt I ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed them in the Suſpicion, which was the Occaſion of my Impriſonment. For, I was ſure, my Actions would be narrowly obſerved.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Caution, made me not refuſe to eat of Swines Fleſh, and drink freely of Wine, when once invited to the <hi>Governour</hi>'s Table. 'Tis true, I had great Scruples and Fears upon me. But, I comforted my ſelf with thoſe Paſſages in the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran,</hi> which ſeem to indulge us this Liberty in Caſe of Neceſſity, by aſſuring us, That <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>Merciful</hi> of the <hi>Merciful,</hi> and that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires not Unreaſonable Performances of his Creatures. Otherwiſe, I ſhould have thought every Morſel I ſwallow'd of that execrable Meat, would have choak'd me, and every Draught of Wine, have been my Poiſon. Tell me, <hi>Great Oracle</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> Whether in this I have not ſinned? I think my ſelf not Innocent, till thou haſt pronounced me ſo. However, this Frankneſs in Eating and Drinking, with the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> without the leaſt Reſerve or Niceneſs, contributed ſomething to their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Opinion of me. Men are generally ſo wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their own Cuſtoms, that he looks like a Monſter, who thwarts them, and does not comply with the preſent Mode. And, the <hi>French,</hi> have a <hi>Proverb, That when a Man's at</hi> Rome, <hi>he muſt live like the</hi> Romans.</p>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:102956:195"/>
                  <p>I believe, I was invited to this <hi>Collation,</hi> in Order to a Diſcovery; and, had I refuſed to eat and drink what was before me, it had, no doubt, been a convincing Argument to theſe <hi>Infidels,</hi> That I was a <hi>Muſſulman.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If I have ſinned in this Point, I humbly crave thy <hi>Abſolution</hi> and <hi>Prayers;</hi> but, if I have done well, inform me, that ſo I may have <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>Conſcience.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I will not therefore make thee melancholy, with a Rehearſal of my Fears and Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, my Wants and Diſcontents, with other doleful Circumſtances of a Priſon. I am now at Liberty, let Sadneſs vaniſh. Yet, I have not ſo forgot my late Grief, as to be now exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in my Joy; ſince I am liable to the ſame, or a Worſe Diſaſter again. It is never good to be ſecure, while we are ignorant what's the next Potion that <hi>Fate</hi> is tempering for us. Moderation keeps a Man upon his Guard; and, if any Stroke of Misfortune be aim'd at him, if he is aware of the Blow, and ſo can ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dextrouſly ward it off, or at leaſt take Honourable Quarter: Whereas, he that ſuffers himſelf to be diſſolv'd, and his Mind unbent with Proſperity, is taken Captive by Evil, without being able to make any eaſie Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:102956:196"/>for himſelf. I love to have my Eyes open, and to look round the whole <hi>Horizon</hi> of Contingencies: I watch for the very Poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Misfortune, that ſo I may not be catch'd napping by a Calamity, but be always in a State to Fence, or make Compoſition.</p>
                  <p>I will now tell thee with more Freedom than I did the <hi>Mufti,</hi> what happened to me during my Impriſonment. The <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> of the <hi>Citadel</hi> where I was confin'd, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited me one Day to a Banquet. I need not give thee an Inventory of the various Diſhes, with which his Table was furniſhed: Our Entertainment was generous, he regal'd me beyond the Expectation of a Priſoner; and, had there not been a deſign in it, I ſhould have admired the Bounty of this <hi>Infidel.</hi> But, his Treat was a Snare, and contrived for a <hi>Teſt</hi> of my <hi>Religion,</hi> Whether I was a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple</hi> of <hi>Mahomet</hi> or <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Thou knoweſt, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> eat Swines Fleſh, and drink Wine, which the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> have in Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. We had Plenty of both at this Feaſt, and I durſt not be ſqueamiſh at either. I tell thee, though I eat of the One with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Pleaſure, yet I drank of the other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Diſguſt. Theſe <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> imitate the Ancient <hi>Grecians</hi> at their Banquets, in drinking of <hi>Healths</hi> to ſuch as they moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem. The <hi>Governour</hi> plied me with Glaſſes, and I quaffed liberally. Policy and Self-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, taught me to begin the Debauch; and, the Charms of that tempting Liquor, would not ſuffer me to ſhrink to the End.
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:102956:197"/>The Wines of <hi>France</hi> are very delicate, and we had choice of the Beſt. The Pleaſure I enjoyed at this Banquet, had almoſt recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled me to the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of <hi>Hali;</hi> and, I could have wiſh'd, our <hi>Prophet</hi> had been in a better Humour, when he forbid us the Juice of the Grape. He promiſes us Rivers of Wine in <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> and, while I was in my Cups, I thought he might connive at us, for taking a Glaſs or two ſometimes on Earth. If thou haſt not yet taſted this Enchanting Liquor, I wiſh thee to abſtain as long as thou liveſt; for otherwiſe, thou wilt find it very difficult, to overcome the Deſires of it, or to live without it. For my Part, I greedily longed for it, before ever I taſted it, becauſe it was forbid: And now I have often had my Fill of it, my Appetite is encreaſed. The more I drink, the greater is my Thirſt after it; which is never like to be quenched, till I ſhall drink at the Original Fountains of Wine in <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not think it is ſo great a Sin, as our <hi>Doctors</hi> would make us believe; ſince, the <hi>Divine Lawgiver</hi> preſcribes Abſtinence from Wine, rather as a Counſel than a Command. If thou art of another Opinion, I Cenſure thee not. The late <hi>Sultan Amurath</hi> was of my Mind; and many <hi>Grandees</hi> at the <hi>Port,</hi> count it no <hi>Hereſie.</hi> All the Danger lies in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, I am no Advocate for Drunkards.</p>
                  <p>Let theſe Things be ſpoken like Words in a Dream, which cannot be remembred again. Thou haſt Prudence enough to take Care, that this Letter fall not into the Hands of ſuch
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:102956:197"/>as ſhall diſpoſe of it in the Wall of the <hi>Hazoda.</hi> It is evident that I love thee, in that I thus frankly diſcloſe ſuch Paſſages, as I would not have others be privy to.</p>
                  <p>After all, I declare I ſhould eſteem my ſelf much more happy, might I exchange <hi>Paris</hi> for <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the moſt delicious Wines of <hi>Europe,</hi> for the wholeſome <hi>Sherbets</hi> of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>May <hi>Heaven</hi> fulfil my Deſire, to ſee thee once again, with the Reſt of my Friends at the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> Continue thy Affection to <hi>Mahmut,</hi> who loves his Friends without Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie. Adieu.</p>
